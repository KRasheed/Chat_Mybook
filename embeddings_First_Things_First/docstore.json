What is priority sett ing? \nII. Why must we set priorities? \nIII. How do we set priorities?  \n This booklet stresses priority setting as a personal \ncommitment made by professional Extension workers. Though Extension workers cooperate with clientele in developing programs and relate d activities, many Extension people don't \nimplement programs unless they see them as their own personal priorities. Though many things influence and pressure Extension people, only an individual can decide whether a goal or activity is high priority and do  something about it.  \nThis booklet discusses priority setting in the context of \nprogram development. This doesn't mean priority setting and program development are synonymous. They aren't. But the priority -setting process may register the most impact in a p rogram \ndevelopment situation and the ideas are transferable to many short-range situations, such as \"what do I do this week?\" \nFurthermore, once a person has set program priorities, those priorities, plus the process s/he has mastered, influence the more immediate and day -to-day priorities.  \nIn Section 3, \"How Do We Set Priorities?\" a case example (a \ncounty home economist) is presented with each step in the 6 -step \nprocess.

Dictionaries say it's:  \n \nThe state of being earlier in time, or of \npreceding something else.  \n \nPrecedence in order, rank, etc.  \n \nThe having of certain rights before another... a preferential rating, especially one that allocates rights and services usually in limited supply ... somethi ng \nmeriting prior attention  \n \nAn Extension concept of priority setting is:  \n \nA dynamic process of deciding what goals or actions \nare most important now, and a commitment of self \nand resources to that decision.  \n \nLet's examine each part of the above statement.  \n \n\"A Dynamic  Priority setting in Extension is a complex professional  \nProcess\"  responsibility. It's a continual process of subjective and  \n    interrelated decisions, a flexibility to respond to problems  \n  as they arise and before they arise. Priorities must  be set in  \n    every phase of program development including: identifying  \n    target audiences, delineating needs, specifying goals, deter  \n mining needed actions and following through with them, and  \n even selecting the very small tasks to be done daily or weekly  \n to accomplish goals.  \n    Our personal job priorities affect others and theirs  \n affect us. The priorities of Extension and our client groups  \n may determine the money and other resources available to  \n us. In turn, our program priorities affect the Ex tension  \n system and the people we serve.  \n \n\"Deciding\"  All of us make decisions all our lives, some of them  \n trivial and some very important. Based on our resources,  \n limitations, and alternatives, we decide what we're going to  \n wear in the morning, what to eat for breakfast, what TV  \n channel to watch, what to do for fun on the weekend, what  \n to do for a living, and how to vote.  \n  The main factors in a thoughtful decision are the same,  \nwhether the question to be decided is trivial or very impor tant.

These are priority alternatives. What to do first? \nWe're helped to decide by knowing the nature of the letters and calls, the topics of the booklets, how we feel, and the schedule for the day ahead. These factors become the criteria for choice.  \nFreedom to choose is a privi lege and a responsibility. \nHowever, we're only as free as our resources, limitations, and alternatives allow. If the whole day is tied up with meetings, we may only have time to return one call. If our alternatives are broad, we have a greater responsibili ty for our choices and \ntheir consequences to others and ourselves. Depending on our roles, our decisions may affect only us, a few others, or even thousands of people.  \nMaking decisions in priority setting involves:  \n \n1. Understanding the priority setting situa tion (what to \ndo today?).  \n \n2. Purpose or goal to be achieved (to use one free \nhour today most effectively).  \n \n3. Available alternatives (letters, booklets, phone calls, \ncoffee break, or conversation).  \n 4. Probable consequences of each alternative (I can \nmake phone calls in the next hour, but I can't get \nthrough all those meetings without coffee).  \n \n5. Values to the decision maker of these probable \nconsequences (my need for the coffee is more \nimportant than returning this call ... or this call is more importan t than my physical need).  \n Priority setting as an application of decision making is \nparticularly complex. The priorities already set, the numbers and needs of the people our current priority setting will affect, and the alternatives available to us all add  to the complexity. In priority \nsetting, decisions are made about what is most urgent and critical. What needs to be done first?  \n \n\"Goals and Actions\"   We need to set priorities on both goals and actions. A  \n goal is what we hope to achieve; actions are how we achieve  \n our goals. We first ask: \"What needs doing? What results  \n do we hope to get?\" And then, \"What must we do to achieve  \n that end? How are we going to do it?\"  \n  Sometimes we get involved in an activity for which we're  \n unsure of the goal. This does n't mean we're not goal -oriented,  \n but it should force us to evolve a goal and decide more spe cific \ndirection for the activity.

A \nspecific goal to achieve that broader goal (for a community development agent) would be to improve the marketing pr ocedures \nof small manufacturers or (for an agriculture agent) to improve the livestock production of farmers in the area.  \n \nGoals may be long - or short -range. For example, a long -\nrange goal might be for the community to provide cultural development activit ies for its citizens. We might anticipate \nbuilding a civic theater or art center sometime in the future. But, a short -range goal to fulfill the same long -range objective might \nbe to hold a successful summer art fair this year.  \n \nGoals may be institutional o r individual. If Extension's goal \nis to provide educational opportunities for low -income senior \ncitizens, our individual program goal might be to sponsor education on low -cost nutrition for the elderly in our county. Or, \nif all the elderly folks in our cou nty are well -off, we may not \nconsider the institutional goal to be important in our programs. On the other hand, if our com munity has a large number of \nlow-income people over 65, we might have initiated the goal for \nthe institution. In Ex tension, these g oals are interrelated.  \n \nActions help us achieve goals. Actions help us achieve \ngoals and clarify goals. If we want to help the community get a cultural center (goal), we can consult with the city planning commission, citizens groups, and art clubs, and hel p them \npetition for a bond issue (actions). For our more im mediate \ngoals, we might help organize a summer art fair committee to get park space for displays, contact artists, and get concessions. The interrelationship of goals and ac tions becomes clearer if we \nsee that the goals we set as priorities become, in turn, bases for setting priorities on our actions.  \nPriority setting as a process relates to any one of the above \ntypes of goals and actions. But, we must see the dif ference \nbetween goals and actions  to set priorities and stick to them. We \ncan't, for instance, say that our home visits or county fair (actions) are a higher priority than improving livestock marketing in a community (goal). That's like com paring apples and \noranges.

We set \npriorities on both our goals and our  actions, since priority implies \na sequence of activities, first things first, as well as a ranking in importance. For instance, it's important to recruit 4 -H leaders and \nto train them --but if there are no leaders to train in a particular \nproject, it's mo re important to recruit them first so we can train \nthem. But if the deadline for 4 -H enrollment is tomorrow, getting \nthe details settled will take priority over both recruiting and training.  \nPriority setting, then, is:  \n \n1. Deciding what needs doing most.  \n2. Deciding what needs doing first.  \n First, we look at our goals to see which is more urgent now. \nSecond, we decide what more specific goals need to be achieved if that long -range goal is to be met. Third, actions must \nbe designed to achieve the goals.  \nHow can we judge what's most important or critical now?  \nOne way is to recognize that priority setting implies looking \nahead to see the future consequences of our actions or lack of action on a problem to help us judge its importance. What will happen if I don' t call the farmer with corn root worm problems, but \ninstead phone fair committee members to arrange a meeting for next week? If I don't call the farmer, his entire crop could be damaged -tomorrow could be too late. But I can still arrange next \nweek's commit tee meeting tomorrow -or have someone else do the \nphoning. Seeing the consequences of our actions certainly helps us determine priorities. Sometimes we can only guess what the possible results of our action or lack of action will be. This is a risk that can  be minimized by getting good in -formation about priority \nalternatives and comparing them (see page 21).  \nThe importance, sequence, and consequences of our \ngoal setting and actions in setting priorities can be shown by how we make gardening decisions.  \nFirst, we must decide on a goal: What do we want to \nharvest at season's end? Tomatoes and corn? But the garden plot is only 4 x 8 feet. Since tomatoes and corn mature at the same time, we won't have enough room for both. Which crop will save us more money at th e supermarket? Since tomatoes \nare more expensive to buy and corn takes up too much room, we'll profit more from a tomato crop.

All these things \nmust be done in sequence to get the desired results at \nsummer's end.  \nSetting program priorities, of course, is a much more \ncomplex and far -reaching process than planning a garden, but it \ntakes the same things into accoun t. \n  \n\"Commitment  Priority setting is critical when many possible alternative  \n of Self and  goals exist and only limited resources to commit to them.  \n Resources  At those times (and they're occurring more and more often),  \n  we must make a professional decisio n and a personal commit ment  \n  to action. Though a group or organization like Extension  \n  sets constraints and parameters on what our priorities ought  \n  to be, only we can commit ourselves. Finally only we can  \n  decide: are we or aren't we going to do it?  \n   As Extension educators, our priorities affect the lives of  \n  countless others. Our information for determining priorities  \n  comes from many people, groups, agencies, and institutions,  \n  including Extension. Our alternatives may be as broad as the  \n  society we serve. We're limited and guided by the goals of  \n  our organization, our job descriptions, the resources available,  \n  and the appropriateness of an activity to our clientele and  \n  their goals. But none of these decides for us or commits us  \n  to a priority. Only we can do that.  \n   Thus setting priorities means saying yes, now, to certain  \n  goals and related actions and then doing them in a first -things \n  first sequence. It also implies reshuffling priorities so goals  \n  and actions of lesser importanc e get less time or fewer re  \n  sources, are done by someone else, or get a no. Deciding not  \n  to do something is as valid as deciding what to do. Deciding  \n  what to do means we won't have time to do certain other things.  \n \n Summary   Setting program prioriti es is a six -step process of con sidering  \n  various alternative goals and actions presented from  \n  many sources, allocating adequate resources and energy to the  \n  most important problems needing immediate attention, and  \n  committing our actions to get resu lts. We must take into  \n  account previously set priorities (ongoing programs), crisis  \n  situations, the goals and thrusts of our institution and/or  \n  program area, past expectations of people, different interest  \n  groups to be served, and available resourc es or expertise, every  \n  time we consider a new priority alternative.  \n   Priority setting isn't easy, but it's necessary.

Some are \nimportant to the clientele groups and larger socie ty we serve; \nsome are important for us to do our jobs well. These reasons \nfall into five categories:  \n \nChanging Needs    1. Priority setting is important to meet the changing   \nand Roles   needs and roles of our audiences.  \n \nThe world is changing at a faster  pace than ever before. \nPeople change, their roles in life change, their needs and problems change. Problems are becoming more complex and interrelated as time goes by. People are better educated and demand more of us today than they did in the past -both in quality \nand quantity. New laws and regulations on the environment, population distribution, pesticides, etc., demand educational as well as legal input. The interrelatedness of problems and institutions creates more challenges for Extension professionals  \nthan in the past. No longer are our programs strictly rural oriented. The farm population has changed and shifted. Much of it has moved to the cities and towns. Farms are getting bigger and more \nspecialized. The need for better farm production on less lan d is \ngreater now than ever before, and the farmer's needs are more complex. People in big cities and small towns need help with their specific problems --and the problems are growing daily.  \nIf Extension is a problem -solving institution, and if Extension \nagents are indeed change agents, we must help people respond \nnot only to present needs and crises, but also to problems of the future: How to deal with new technologies? What constitutes a healthy human being? How can we help people prepare for the changes th e future will demand?  \nBut Extension resources are limited. We can't be all things to \nall people, even though the demands are great. Setting priorities and sticking to them is the only way to apply glue to a problem instead of a watery paste that spreads it self thin over many \nprojects -and wears off in a short time.  \nExtension priorities and our program priorities must not \nmerely follow the trends of society. We must be in the advance guard of future problems, to prevent them before they occur or to help peop le meet them when they're inevitable. We must be \nflexible enough to respond to people's needs, but firm enough to stick with priorities and reach defined goals.  \n   \n \n12", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f9b891b-895e-4432-b8da-d923c76ccd0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f9b891b-895e-4432-b8da-d923c76ccd0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e61dc072-5649-47ae-b8a4-b1f215cbbe7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "d41cb2a65ae8704fa75067116710dec47a56e8be91957d75c461f91e5b27931a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "602fb8e7-67bf-48d6-9831-20eb5d6b8e8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "f62b8668c0a2aefd08c2a90744c9072334d566595a780ec01eee0df8281c0a9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c052da11-59aa-4d46-85a5-4c7860ece8ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "fbcdbf51b16dc8fc4d2cf9356e32ca964e58e9dbfe8ef4c8f263e9aded7fed57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4173285659e16aa15d3b0ba4e1cddb45b7f8a2a251164b8e180d05f91e922817", "text": "Helps Prevent    \n Crises  \n   2.  Prior ity setting helps us prevent future crisis.    \n   \n   President Kennedy once said he asked experts to advise  \n   him \"not what should I do, but what will happen if I do?\"  \n   We must take the consequences of our actions into  \n  account as we set priorities so w e can make judgments about  \n  what we do in the present. What will happen if I do or don't  \n  do something?  \n   Doing something, for instance, may be the cause of a  \n  future crisis. What we envision as a cure may end up being  \n  worse than the disease. Phospha tes brought us whiter wash  \n  loads, but with them came lake pollution. The dangers of  \n  DDT may be worse than the bugs it was supposed to destroy.  \n   On the other hand, a crisis may occur if we don't do  \n  something.

We also need to plan time for emerging,  \n  \"time-is-right\" concerns.

If so, we'll need to tactfully explain to certain constituent groups why we can no longer give as much time as they expect to their high priority goals and activities.  \nA third way to treat prior or ongoi ng commitments is to \nrecognize some are going to take your time no matter what you do. Therefore, you may simply wish to set aside a cer tain percentage \nof your time for them (40% -70%) and think only of the remaining \nportion of your time as you set new pri ority goals and related \nactivities.  \nRegardless of the approach, all traditional, repetitious, and \nongoing activities and commitments, as well as emerging concerns, must be considered when setting new priorities.  \nBesides looking at ongoing and current commi tments, you \nshould also take a good look at the resources available. How much time do you have? Back up support? Dollars for travel and supplies? Listing your resources provides a prac tical tool not only \nfor assessing your own situation, but also for expl aining that \nsituation to others.  \nComparing both lists --your current commitments and the \nresources at your disposal -will help you more clearly describe \nthe situation you're in, deal more effectively with setting priorities for the near - and long -range futur e, and allocate or \nredirect your resources wisely.  \n \nFour Sources   Though Extension educators must make hard professional  \nof Influence  decisions on priorities, they don't act alone during any of  \nthe priority -setting steps. Many sources of pressure and in fluence are \nresponsible for the activities we're already in volved in, but they also \nprovide information, criteria, alter natives, resources, and cooperation \nfor our priorities.  \n  The following four sources, shown in Exhibit 1, influence  \n our program priorit ies: \n   1.

But no matter how our priorities and  \n theirs differ, no matter how much we end up doing \"their  \n thing,\" it's important to recognize that we make the decision  \n to act or not to act. Thus, whatever we decide becomes a  \n personal priority to us, whether we like it or not, simply be  \n cause we've opted to do it.  \n  Often our biggest problem is to set program priorities  \n among the myriad possibilities presented by the sources of  \n influence. These sources may voluntarily come forth  with \n suggestions or demands for programs on problems of priority  \n concern to them. These suggestions and demands are the alternatives from which we must select priorities. These sources\n aren't to be looked on as \"bad,\" even though they'll cause  \n us problems by suggesting more than we can possibly do. In  \n fact, they're absolutely necessary and helpful sources of  \n influence.

Sampling is the most efficient  \n  way to survey the community as a whole or particular client  \n  groups.  \n   A more complicated, but useful, survey approach for  \n  setting priorities is the Focus Delphi Process, which involves  \n  returning to the same respondents three or four times to get  \n  their reactions to priorities identified ea rlier and to get their  \n  information about priorities as you begin to narrow down  \n  possible alternatives.  \n  Observation   You can get useful facts for priority setting by reading  \n  newspaper letters to the editor, counting the number of news  \n  stories abou t a topic, listening to radio call -in shows, studying  \n  participation numbers for past learning experiences on a topic,  \n  checking the popularity of particular library books, and looking  \n  at election results.

Public relations may be a top priority but it will be enhanced more by effective, results -oriented programming on \npriorities than by our mere presence at a meeting.\n \n27", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8260b040-0099-4298-b068-c9f2cf0833d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8260b040-0099-4298-b068-c9f2cf0833d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef9e22f3-224f-40ba-8917-bf21ee12eb8c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "952fd163696429406b38af18d3c80dc2696ce1e9762e9c06abd8692278e78c84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9e8d5fe-dad4-4f5a-81a8-e5e9e21453d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "42a958b2212ef84dbdc24d060f1a83741559deba184e2f76a6cda3589794935e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "65ffe3a1-1c3b-410c-a7eb-a1a6f107147e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "6d494f2e1621bb46018d174cca262e83ac9aa6d9d16c50e1ed7b85527450ae19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4e424e04aad74c18f662f7bb312e1376aea5560b7442e89f23d548a1c2a5007a", "text": "CASE STUDY: Mary Ann W alker, Home Economist (cont.)  \n \n \nSTEP 2:   Mary Ann Walker knew where to go to find alternative \npriority  \nIdentifying the  concerns, but she had to be careful when approaching her \npossible priorities   sources to find out their perceived priorities. She had to make            \n.                                               sure the priorities she finally chose would get support.  \n  \n  \nSelf-  Mary Ann started with herself to find her own priority concerns and interests. \nShe took an inventory of her current commitme nts and noted which ones she'd like to \ncarry further. She examined her own programming interests: the things she liked to do \nand got rewards from doing. She noted the things she thought were worthwhile and needed by the community. She read newspapers, book s, newsmagazines and journals; \nwatched television documentaries; talked with people; kept up to date on societal needs and related them to the needs of her own community and specific clientele. Mary Ann's own personal values, interests, and perceptions of what's important would greatly affect \nher commitment to the priorities finally set.  \n \nSociety & Community -  Mary Ann has been constantly in touch with the needs of \nher community through contacts with her Extension committee, county board, and certain civic groups and service clubs. At priority -setting time, she surveyed community \nneeds by geographic area or municipality. She used the brainstorming method with her advisory groups to discover and define specific needs of communities and the county. She checked  to see how many of those were related to state or societal needs in \ngeneral.  \n \nSpecific clientele -  Mary Ann maintained contact with representatives of the specific \nclientele groups she served throughout her experience as home econornist. She risked all these groups, including those with whom she might conduct programs even if she hadn't \nprogrammed with each of them. Her own memory also provided a good list of priority needs. Still, she felt each group should be contacted at program planning time, especiall y \nthose with whom she had no recent contact. She called on the fair board, 4 -H council, \nwomen's groups, Homemakers Clubs, social action and service agencies, consumer groups, and representatives of the elderly and minorities. She used statistical data for information about specific groups of people in her community and their needs.  \n \nExtension organization -  Mary Ann knew the priorities of her state Extension \norganization and her program area. Statewide program planning committees, memos, district meetings, contact with state specialists, and her fellow agents in and near her \ncounty kept her in touch with needs she would find in her own county. By knowing what state specialists were saying, what trends they discovered, what programs and materials they were wo rking on, what resources they'd be ready to provide, and what had been done \nin other counties that might be useful to her, she found it easier to discover and meet her own programming needs. The national Extension Home Economics Focus II helped her recogni ze national or societal needs and their relationships to needs of her community.  \n \nAll these sources of influence provided information for Mary Ann. But she needed to \nbe sure which source carried more weight in helping her decide priorities. Perhaps she values her own principles and ideas more than any of the others'. Perhaps she gets the \nmost support and recognition from the Extension organization. Perhaps she's most concerned with a few clientele groups with which she's been successful or whose needs she sees as most critical. It may be that her overview of society and the future makes her \nmore aware of the total society's needs over the particular needs of its segments. She examined these influences on her priorities. They would affect her objectivity, but  she was \naware it was a subjective decision she had to make.  \n \n28", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65ffe3a1-1c3b-410c-a7eb-a1a6f107147e": {"__data__": {"id_": "65ffe3a1-1c3b-410c-a7eb-a1a6f107147e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8971d4b7-179b-403f-a2b9-349ec4c0a2d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "c4868f75dd3e8398c6e4d238c8c1a5abd080c0649a3fe92d8d6d2e8593512d08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8260b040-0099-4298-b068-c9f2cf0833d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "4e424e04aad74c18f662f7bb312e1376aea5560b7442e89f23d548a1c2a5007a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ddbd2d7f-a677-4d2c-bff0-0cd873b5f68b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "61904b198082762cb7949f1656fc7039f2b06fbcd3f4368ca15aefdda72857cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6d494f2e1621bb46018d174cca262e83ac9aa6d9d16c50e1ed7b85527450ae19", "text": "After checking with all her sources and viewing the overlap among the suggested \nalternative goals for the next several years, Mary Ann found herself weighting input \nfrom Extension and  specific client groups more, her own input second, and societal \ninput the least.

How do we determine  \n the urgency of one important priorit y over another?  \n  We can only choose by determining the rules of the  \n game in advance. These rules are called criteria.  \n \nIdentifying   Identifying what criteria we'll use to select priorities  \nCriteria  may be the most critical of the six priority -setting ste ps. The  \n criteria are the bases on which we select priorities and the  \n defense for our eventual choice. The criteria are the reasons  \n we designate certain goals and activities as higher priority  \n than others.  \n  For instance, if the criteria of immediate ne ed, economic  \n benefits, and numbers affected are identified as most impor tant, we \nmight choose a program on weed -free, optimum  \n fertility corn production for 1,000 area farmers, rather than  \n a home gardening program for 400 families. That choice  \n might be  reversed if only 100 corn growers were affected as  \n opposed to 1500 home gardeners, or if the criteria of economic  \n benefits were changed to personal satisfaction and productive  \n leisure benefits.  \n Weighting   Thus, we must carefully select and weight the criteria  \nCriteria  we use to choose. Aside from our actual priority possibilities,  \n the criteria we select have the greatest effect on our eventual  \n priorities.  \n  Particular criteria are important in themselves, but even  \n more important is who says so. Even tually, you'll decide which  \n criteria carry more weight than others, but the sources of  \n criteria will help you do that weighing.  \n  Therefore, the sources of possible priority alternatives  \n are also the sources of criteria. Some of the same approaches,  \n techniques, and channels of communication used to identify  \n possible priorities can also be used to identify criteria.  \n  An additional technique, \"value clarification,\" is most  \n useful to identify criteria. Value clarification can be used to  \n identify the im portance of your own criteria and to help  \n others identify theirs.

Both steps can be integrated into some of the same activities. By involving the four sources of influence in identifying po ssible priorities and criteria \nfor selecting among them, you'll establish a situa tion for these \nsame groups to support the commitments you make later.  \nTo help ensure that the priorities you select are truly the best \nones, and to avoid alienation of specif ic groups, it's wise to select \na balanced group of criteria that reflects social, economic, environmental, and human development concerns. Some examples are: environmental protection, benefits to groups and community organizations, learning and educational  development, \nhealth and safety, enhancement of human values, etc. If your criteria are too heavily loaded in one direction (that is, economic concerns with disregard for the environment or vice versa), a group with broader or different interests might wel l be alienated -or \nyour priorities may not be the best ones.  \nBut it's a different -and necessary -matter to identify which \ncriteria will carry more weight in your decision, which ones are most critical at this time. If you don't, you either won't be able to determine your priorities or else you may end up with mediocre, \nwatered -down program goals and actions.  \nSome other examples of criteria are: readiness of client \ngroups, availability of resources and back up support, time necessary, volunteers committed to n eeded task, contribution to \nExtension or program area mission, improvement of social equality, personal satisfaction or rewards, expertise, budget, contribution to the solution of other problems, etc.  \nCriteria come from the four sources of influence on the  job. \nYour task in Step 3, then, is to identify and list the criteria from each source of influence (including yourself) and to weigh their importance, depending on their source, your job situation, and the priority -setting situation you face.  \nThough no fo rmula exists to objectively identify and weigh \ncriteria, the funnel idea in Exhibit 2 shows how the criteria you select from the four sources of influence are like screens or filters in a funnel.  \nThe criteria from the community and society are broadest in \nnature and allow the most projects and possible priorities through.  \nThe specific client groups you work with offer the next set of \ncriteria to screen possible priorities. They're more specific and thus more discriminating. They may even conflict with each other or \nwith criteria from the other sources.  \nThe third source -the Extension organization -also has \ncriteria to screen out certain alternatives that don't fit the  \nExtension mission or resources.  \n \n \n \n31", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bf34094-5607-4d2a-86b6-944dca73980e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bf34094-5607-4d2a-86b6-944dca73980e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "538fbd7e-c760-4dc8-9827-e3f8a412de31", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "a60f428c643b0d6c171a30f720232bba4dc23a736dd5447e316a6299ec2720de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06580aab-aa25-40e6-bdb9-970ea4a5e008", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "8b57878ed5fb038b292079b6ab20b85f45c7ae0da8251dab32cf1cad5166aab0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a918c9a-7baf-44a1-8032-0ee0bc7573ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "148e542f35b09ec265a6332846969cab31cfd99f5e2a42ecf6bbda7189ad7d61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "421b4fc81abf0d96f91bc1d2335f78a41cd31d8d49513746dfc943b3d611d39c", "text": "Summary   The final filter, however, is you.

At one time, people relied on dogma and religion to guide their decisions on what was important in their lives. With the advent of scientific observation and empirical research, however, we now fi nd it difficult to accept as valuable anything that can't be \nscientifically proven.

The reasoning process can quickly b ecome \nvery complex, so make sure your criteria are well identified in advance.  \nThe reasoning process occurs within the funnel described \nin Step 3. Each possible priority alternative is passed through the screens of the funnel (selected criteria of each sou rce of \ninfluence). If the priority possibility meets the criteria, it passes. If it doesn't it's thrown out or blocked in the funnel. You're the final filter. Your own criteria will help you select the most important priorities from those alternatives that  pass through the criteria of \nthe other three sources.  \n    \n \n36", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9af2fb32-6a5a-4941-84cb-41ca92f007f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "9af2fb32-6a5a-4941-84cb-41ca92f007f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6f04640b-89cc-4e61-a480-d9dcf7377a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "4100c4b1b968e90cd3e02dc87ac802fc2e3d295b8db54be1bed495fbc792ee8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff5a577d-8956-4e7d-8895-54f30c12c9c2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "fa5df22aea9fba86dadaca0a9b38138e40e8e752a11631bc051ba69f9696c5cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9bc3d5ab-8cf1-44eb-99e6-2e18f95b62cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "01c0277fa7603e58bd90fc7bae71a6fa3fb427c1ce7c202f71b6c5c6252c76a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "15d1bb8d6aabe17e0dc59dd62da60b796454862584b8ef88e985782f3b275b15", "text": "There are many ways to get possible priorities and criteria \nfrom sources of influence.

It's something that must be done first, before something else -to deal with an immediate crisis, to \nprevent a future crisis, or to enable a later action or goal to be accomplished.  \nIn Step 5 we look ahead to see the future consequences \nof our action or inaction on a priority. We decide what goals or subgoals need to be reached fir st, what needs to be done next, \nand how much time must be devoted to necessary activities.  \nThere are two critical questions in this step:  \n \n Consider Future   What are the future consequences of my action or  \n Consequences  inaction on this priority?

What part of the problem needs to be solved first.  \n5. The complexity of the problem  and how much \ntime it needs.  \n6. Potential payoff and future consequences of \nundertaking or neglecting a priority.  \n7. What other activities are needed to precede the \nmajor activity.  \n \nMany of these criteria to determine timing depend on the \ncapacity of group s to accept a priority and the resources \navailable to undertake it. The relationship of a priority to limited \nresources comes to the forefront in this step.  \nTo illustrate the time dimension, let's presume you've \nassigned higher importance to three programs  and lower \nimportance to another five possible alternatives. In this step, you can put the five lower priorities on the back burner and deal only with the three high priorities.  \nTo treat these three important priorities, you must ask \nyourself which one nee ds more time in the next year or so. \nThose priorities that involve more people, are more socio political \nthan technical, involve more social barriers, need more resources and backup, are newer in nature, are inter related with \nother problems, and need more  legitimation and preparation, will \nrequire more time. If you have 120 days of flexible time open in the next year, you may find your top priority requires 50 or more of those days, your second priority may need 40, and the third may need 30.  \n \n Work  Once you've allotted time to the various priorities, you  \n Backwards  must determine the necessary timing and sequencing of  \n from Goals  activities if priority goals are to be achieved. For instance, if  \n  your priority is to achieve a goal two years from now, you  \n  should consider what subgoals need to be achieved before  \n  then. What activities are needed, in what order or sequence,  \n  if the bigger or more long -range goal is to be achieved?  \n   You can better sequence goals and related actions if  \n  you ask yourself:  \n    1. What subgoals must be met before the ultimate  \n    goal is achieved?  \n   2. What actions need to precede others to achieve  \n    these goals?  \n    By starting with the perceived goal and working  \n  backwards in time you can determine the necessary sequen ce \n  of events, activities, and subgoals that must precede the  \n  ultimate goal. You'll be surprised how many times we need  \n  to have something done yesterday if we expect something  \n  else to be achieved three years from now.  \n   We really haven't set priori ties until we've dealt with  \n  both the value (Step 4) and time dimensions (Step 5).  \n  \n \n40", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

For \nexample, other priority alternatives might become apparent \nduring Step 5. Or your programming situation may be more clear after examining the possible priority alternatives. Or you might discover more criteria or reassign  levels of value to \npriorities after you've reflected on your high priorities and dealt with the questions of timing and future consequences.  \nBut the order will hold true in most cases.

Nothing, unless you communicate to  \n  all your sources of influence your job situation, the critical  \n  ness of setting priorities, your good r easons for the priorities  \n  you've set, and your intention to meet them. Support from  \n  fellow professionals is a must.  \n   Saying some priorities are higher is like saying \"yes\" to  \n  them. When others are assigned lower priority it's like saying  \n  \"no\"-or \"maybe\" -to them. However, you can say 64no))  \n  indirectly. Let your high priorities speak for you. Said in  \n  the \"right\" way, your message will be clear and won't offend  \n  or alienate people. For example, you can tell them your  \n  priorities will change aft er you've focused on certain things  \n  for a year or two, long enough to make a difference or get  \n  the job done. You can use your priority -setting group meetings  \n  (if you use such a technique) to reinforce these ideas. You may  \n  also assign some lower pri orities to other people, agencies, or  \n  groups. Can someone else do it? Can you give a lower priority  \n  a little time and let others carry the ball?  \n   However you treat the lower priorities, you must make  \n  clear your commitment to the high priorities you 've set.  \n  Making your intentions publicly known to others is one of  \n  the best steps toward commitment.  \n \n Resources   A key reason for setting priorities in the first place is  \n  because our limited resources can't meet all the demands.  \n  Thus, resource all ocation is critical to priority setting and  \n  it's also the best way to commit ourselves to priorities.  \n   One way of communicating priorities is to get resources  \n  allocated, to get the help of specialists and other Extension  \n  people scheduled, and to ge t money budgeted in ways that  \n  make it difficult to pick up new activities unrelated to high  \n  priorities. The very act of getting resource and backup support  \n  communicates your commitments to others. Plans of work or  \n  calendars of events aren't simply busywork. They protect your  \n  time by blocking it off for priorities. They can help you  \n  practice two -way communication in the Extension organization.  \n  Action   Many excellent empirical research studies have shown  \n  that the best predictors of one's futur e behavior are one's  \n  previous outward actions and behavior in the presence of  \n  others. For example, if you wish to know whether someone  \n  will organize a meeting for you, look to people who have  \n  done it in the past, or who have publicly expressed a  \n  willingness to do it. You can use the same principle to  \n  enhance your commitment and protect your priorities. By  \n  publicly telling others your priorities and intentions, you've  \n  performed an overt, public action that you and others see.  \n \n  \n44", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4e60c92-45ec-4098-a3b3-350878d04eb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4e60c92-45ec-4098-a3b3-350878d04eb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "57bdb99c-0597-43ee-836c-ef98f70462eb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "ea792bb251555121d7d15086f7ce3aaf47c8d05bac432f76eda9963cd409a472", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7dbf25e7-8aff-420c-b1cc-9a1ef831844c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "a8378fe951594988cd67108f429ec2b0eb96e1bf3777589231768a410937c0e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a7a12ebb-9a2f-4865-86ca-8199be3e36c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "2313789a00048cb1dc4cb4faaed40ec268ee3691d19efe9fa4df5164ab4e7f52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "eb0da4faaa328aae20dec105bd32fe98042f3bc255ee46fa5aa1ef2919f6a772", "text": "Your plan o f work or efforts to secure resources and Extension \nsupport are such public actions. The commitment works both ways.  \nOld sayings like \"actions speak louder than words,\" or put \nyour money where your mouth is,\" indicate that the best ways to \ntell others your  priorities are the actual activities you plan and the \nprograms you conduct. If you haven't set priorities, or if you have dealt with things superficially, it will be more difficult to convince others of your intentions. Eventually, however, if you've comm itted \nyourself to action, others will see your Extension role as purposeful and directed by the priorities you've set with others.  \nThe best possible action you can take towards commitment \nis to plan activities using the working -backwards idea. If you \ndevelop such a plan of action and then let your clientele groups \nand organization know about it, you'll place them and yourself on the spot. You'll have deadlines to meet -an excellent incentive to \nget things done. If you've called a meeting for March 9, sent letters to clientele, scheduled resource people and a meeting \nplace, and announced the meeting to the mass media, it will be pretty hard to postpone work on a priority goal the meeting was designed to enhance. Without such planned actions, deadlines, and rea l activities, a list of priorities could sit meaningless in your \nfiles for years.  \nThe closer we can get to overt action, the better our \ncommitment to priorities will be.  \n \nFlexibility   Extension work has been a success because of the  \n tireless efforts of pe ople like you who have helped others  \n with their concerns and problems. Much of Extension's  \n reputation is due to its flexibility and readiness to respond  \n when needed. We aren't suggesting that you or any other  \n Extension worker drop the concept of flexib ility. You must  \n be able to respond to requests and emergency situations as  \n they arise. The idea of flexibility is not contrary to priority  \n setting. When emergencies arise, you'll have to decide, first,  \n whether they're within the scope of Extension's mi ssion \n (priorities). If so, respond.  \n  Second, let's realize that emergencies always develop.  \n Why not build into your schedule some time for dealing with  \n those emergencies? You can't plan 100% of your time and  \n still be able to deal with emergencies. Pla n for flexibility.  \n  In summary, the outcome of this sixth step in priority  \n setting is a commitment to priorities that we and others have  \n determined are most important now. Commitment is much  \n more possible if we have designed actions to meet our priorit y \n goals, have communicated our intentions to clientele, to the  \n community, to the Extension system, and most important, to  \n ourselves. Goals are important, but only actions will get results.  \n    \n45", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7a12ebb-9a2f-4865-86ca-8199be3e36c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7a12ebb-9a2f-4865-86ca-8199be3e36c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "080cdf87-443e-4f4b-8fb7-4b6ac91cd20b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "cd221bf87adc4c886ddc2a203f5e560ef395f9ef9e64dcefabb67721cf00ea90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4e60c92-45ec-4098-a3b3-350878d04eb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "eb0da4faaa328aae20dec105bd32fe98042f3bc255ee46fa5aa1ef2919f6a772", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9538eaa6-340e-440b-a7e7-34208e0922eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "c7bc88905d564a13825605cedc7418ee355455f7040cc7859bdd7121ef3f85aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2313789a00048cb1dc4cb4faaed40ec268ee3691d19efe9fa4df5164ab4e7f52", "text": "CASE STUDY.

But the concepts can apply to short - or \nlong-term situations,  and to non -Extension programming \nsituations as well. The critical ideas are:  \n \n1. Limited resources, accountability, the increasing \ncomplexity and interrelatedness of problems, and \nother factors demand that we set our priorities.  \n2. Some goals and actions are more \nimportant than others.  \n3. Some goals and actions need to be \naccomplished before others.  \n4. Someone needs to decide what goals and \nactions are high priority.  \n5. All situations of individuals are different, but \nunderlying principles apply to many si tuations.  \n6. Four sources of influence put pressure on us as \nExtension professionals in setting priorities. They also provide possible priorities and criteria to judge them.  \n7. The Extension professional is ultimately responsible \nfor considering all factor s and making personal \ncommitments to high priorities.  \n8. Criteria need to be used to determine priorities. \nOne important criterion is the future consequences of our actions.  \n9. Setting priorities is worthless unless commitment \nand action follow.  \n10. Two -way communication with sources of influence \nis necessary to set priorities and stick to them.  \n \nIf you understand these concepts and are committed to \nset priorities, you are on the first step of a road that leads to results.  \n47", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01560ec7-8c51-4198-a132-44851e682a22": {"__data__": {"id_": "01560ec7-8c51-4198-a132-44851e682a22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "592b7be5-bf84-4561-b2e1-5f13d58b07c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "888fe7d62e68fcf907e40417210e0a47f094231eef7c542d62aa8b2f74a9c317", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9538eaa6-340e-440b-a7e7-34208e0922eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "c7bc88905d564a13825605cedc7418ee355455f7040cc7859bdd7121ef3f85aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4943dd4b-3fc4-46f8-8b8d-46f5590d9836", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "daad7d272f315aeed9b86f06039c9d114ba0bfc177f3de8617da4c6336a96b89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ccf0ac78069ec9fc18abb95e8e1ccdcdcdb18b8c36c5d8b3abc59d877cc2e776", "text": "Priority Setting --  \nThree Case  Studies  \n \n     \nCASE STUDY: Dick Snelling, County Youth Agent  \n \nSTEP 1:   Dick Snelling, a youth agent, spent a great deal of time \nUnderstanding   each year working with local volunteers to plan 4 -H \nthe priority -setting  and other programs for youth.  \nsituation  \n His overall program goals --developing human relations and  \ncommunity responsibility, enhancing career exploration, encouraging values \nclarification, and helping youth develop coherent life styles, were ongoing statewide concerns  each year.  \n \nBut Dick had priority problems. After discussing his situation with others, Dick \nconcluded that the problems were caused by the poor connection between overall program goals and the local activities he conducted with local 4 -H leaders. Some said \nthe broad statewide goa ls would mean more if he could develop some specific local \ngoals related to the statewide thrusts. County activities would also relate better to such local goals. Dick decided to identify some of them by going to the sources of influence on his job.  \n \nDick's job was influenced by sources similar to Mary Ann Walker's, the home \neconomist. He had to consider the community and society, which asked him to plan \nprograms for youth to learn the basics of citizenship, cooperation, and relating to other people. He dis covered the society's needs and priorities through mass media, \nschool programs, Extension committees, his own sense of values, research, and opinion polls.  \n \nDicks's specific clients were the 4 -H club members, leaders, and parents in his \ncounty. He also con ducted short -term youth projects for non -4-H club members. \nThese audiences told him their expectations for 4 -H and youth programs through the \ncounty 4 -H leaders' council, phone calls, and office visits.  \n \nThe Extension organization influenced his programs t hrough his district 4 -H \nprogram leaders, other specialists, written support materials, financial support, other agents, and the local Extension committee.  \n \nFinally, Dick's own values and experiences affected his priorities. He was raised \non a farm, had 4 -H experiences as a boy, and raised beef calves and gave \ndemonstrations in his project work He also lived with other students at college who came from large cities and became interested in urban 4 -H and disadvantaged youth. \nDick needed to set priorities on a  county 4 -H program that would reflect his own \nvalues, as well as the values and priorities of his other sources of influence  \n \n48", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4943dd4b-3fc4-46f8-8b8d-46f5590d9836": {"__data__": {"id_": "4943dd4b-3fc4-46f8-8b8d-46f5590d9836", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65cdf3e1-7d55-46af-a24b-d7b509624cea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "5aea3c4170f7de72aa99df60298893f4645a667992e36c7e3c3da2bbc6151420", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "01560ec7-8c51-4198-a132-44851e682a22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "ccf0ac78069ec9fc18abb95e8e1ccdcdcdb18b8c36c5d8b3abc59d877cc2e776", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "78ce9956-af96-49a8-82f1-05172c765fc6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "29393c6dac5de438bd9aae7082725e5ac4648fa06060082710fdff58d58bb4a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "daad7d272f315aeed9b86f06039c9d114ba0bfc177f3de8617da4c6336a96b89", "text": "STEP 2:   Dick felt his audiences were well identified. Other \nIdentifying   Extension people agreed with him that his focus ought to  \nthe possible  be maintaining and improving the local and county4 -H Club  \npriorities  programs and special non -4-H youth programs.  \n  \n \n As he considered how to get input on possible priority -goals for his county, Dick \ndecided to work primarily within t he current organization and ask leaders and 4 -H \nmembers what they saw as priorities. The annual 4 -H leaders' council county meeting \nwas a good way to start the process.  \n \nAt the meeting, Dick explained his need to set priorities to the group. He \noutlined th e existing statewide goals, his current activities, the difference between \ngoals and activities, the need for two -way communication and getting input on \npriorities.  \n \nHe arranged the leaders and members into buzz groups to brainstorm on these \nquestions:  \n \n1 . Of existing 4 -H statewide goals, which ones should we focus on in \nnext year's county youth program?  \n2. Within the statewide goals, what community problems, issues, and concerns should we deal with to improve our local 4 -H program?  \n3. Considering both the  statewide goals and our community concerns, \nwhat goals should be high priority?  \n \nAs a result of the brainstorming sessions and a later followup with non -4-H \nclub groups Dick developed this list of possible priority goals:  \n \n1. Develop more leadership in wo od and mechanical projects.  \n2. Improve communication among leaders, agents, and parents,  \n3. Improve quality of work in member -initiated projects.  \n4. Expand 4 -H to urban and disadvantaged youth.  \n5. Expand opportunities for junior leadership.  \n6. Increase pro ject training in all projects.  \n7. Increase development of community projects by clubs.  \n8. Increase sharing of leadership by local clubs.  \n9. Improve recreational training.  \n10. Develop a family -oriented 4 -H program.  \n \nThis list of goals seemed long to Dick. S ome goals and commitments and \nmany more on -going activities were already locked in. But it showed Dick why he \nhad a priority -setting problem. He began to see that several of his current activities \nwere unrelated to priority goals.  \n \nSTEP 3:   Dick set criter ia for choosing among these alternatives by  \nIdentifying  relying on input from his state program leaders, 4 -H Club \ncriteria for   members and leaders, and himself.  \nselecting priorities    \n \nThrough letters and discussions with his program leader, he concluded  he should use \nthe statewide program goals as basic criteria for whether the more specific local goals were high priority or not. If a particular goal would greatly help 4 -Hers achieve a \nstatewide program goal, such as \"clarification of personal values,\" t hat goal would be a \nhigh priority.  \n \nThe district program leader also pointed out the following possible criteria:  \n\u2022 Resources and available specialist help.  \n\u2022 Amount of time being given by others to certain \nactivities.  \n \n49", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78ce9956-af96-49a8-82f1-05172c765fc6": {"__data__": {"id_": "78ce9956-af96-49a8-82f1-05172c765fc6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "497daa00-b7dc-4f16-8b70-a46669e00b97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "bd552b4849f3cfc0857ed72c3bfcb3f0a8eb8fde2df5be009f35c6f936056841", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4943dd4b-3fc4-46f8-8b8d-46f5590d9836", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "daad7d272f315aeed9b86f06039c9d114ba0bfc177f3de8617da4c6336a96b89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "45383b3b-c207-4d70-9921-f2420c4cedb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "3ed4ce698d5e89e2c4a247f970ac043a4844033ee8e7ba2695010b1a3f5116cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "29393c6dac5de438bd9aae7082725e5ac4648fa06060082710fdff58d58bb4a9", "text": "\u2022 The type of inservice training  intended for the coming year for youth \nagents.  \n\u2022 The amount of controversy surrounding some goals. \n\u2022 The possibility of a priority increasing 4 -H \nmembership.  \n \nAt the annual 4 -H executive council meeting, Dick approached his leaders and \nmembers for their i deas on how they and he together should decide priority goals for \nthe coming year. In their buzz groups, they came up with the following criteria for assigning priorities:  \n \n1. Number of kids affected.  \n2. Interest of parents and leaders.  \n3. Was event a succ ess last year?  \n4. Has anyone suggested changes or additions to last year's program?  \n5. Dick's time.  \n6. Leaders' time.  \n7. Travel and distance.  \n \nDick agreed with most of the ideas he got from his 4 -H organization and from his \ndistrict leader. He recognized t he need to build programs on the past, but he questioned \nwhether last year's success, among other criteria stated -by leaders, wouldn't lead to \nstatic, traditional programs. He therefore also came up with these criteria:  \n \n1. Will goal stimulate members' in terest in their community?  \n2. Will goal serve most projects and clubs in county?  \n3. Will goal encourage both cooperation and competition?  \n4. Will it be educational?  \n \nSTEP 4:   Dick decided to share the list of possible priority goals and  \nDetermining  criteria with various people identified at the next 4 -H executive  \nthe relative   council meeting. He explained again that he needed to set  \nimportance of  priorities and select certain activities. He asked them to use  \npriorities  the criteria listed under Step 3 in  assigning rank order to  \n the 10 possible priority goals on the sheet.  \n \nThough Dick put more of the responsibility back on the group, he stressed the \nimportance of his criteria.  \n \nAs the votes were tabulated and communicated to the group, the list looked like this:  \n \n1 . Expand 4 -H to urban and disadvantaged youth.  \n2. Improve communication among leaders, parents, and agents.  \n3. Improve quality of member -initiated work.  \n4. Increase leadership in wood and mechanical projects.  \n5. Increase project training in all  projects.  \n6. Increase development of community projects by clubs.  \n \nDick realized that the first item on the list was important . . . but there were no cities \nlarger than 40,000 in his county. He also realized that state youth specialists were developing a  plan for expanding 4 -H to disadvantaged rural youth. Inservice training and \nmaterials would be ready in another year. He decided his aptitude and resources to tackle that difficult job would be greater in another year, especially if well -trained leaders w ere \ndeveloped this year to lead ongoing programs while he dedicated a lot of time next year to expanding the 4 -H program.  \nTherefore, he selected the following interrelated goals as his top priorities for the year ahead:  \n \n1. Improve quality of member - initiated project work.  \n2. Improve communication among leaders, parents, and agents.  \n3.

Dick still asked himself several reflective  \nconsequences  questions:  \nand timing  \n  1. Are all pertinent facts available and do they support  \n   these priorities?  \n \n2. Is the goal likely to be achieved?  \n \n3. Are people ready for it? \n \n4. Do people know about it?  \n 5. Are the goals more appropriate for certain groups than for others?  \n 6. Are members and leaders aware of the time it will take to pursue the goals?  \n 7. Will the priority goals help increase the impact of traditional even ts and their relationship to overall 4 -H \ngoals? \n \nThese questions made Dick realize that if the quality of member -initiated project \nwork was really to improve by next year, it would be necessary to develop a sequence of subgoals and ac tivities. He began to  ask more questions.  \n \nWe want improved project work next year. What projects? What members? Who \nneeds it most? What's the present quality of work? What do leaders and parents need to do? What materials are available? Many decisions had to be made before a calendar of \nactivities to meet the goal would materialize.  \n \nDick's head began to swim. He began to realize there was more to getting \nmembers to im prove the quality of their work than just saying so. He needed a plan to \nget people involved in making decisi ons and carrying out actions.  \n \nThe project completion date was August 1. If leaders had to review and judge \nthe projects by July 15, about 4 months remained for members to do their work. Members would need a better understanding of project work, its purpos es, standards \nof expected quality, and necessary skills by March 15.  \n \nDick saw even more need for planning a calendar of activities for things that had \nto happen first. Leaders would need project training in February and March. He hadn't realized how close ly related his Number 1 and 3 priorities were, but he could see that \nproject training for leaders had now become an activity in support of a larger goal. Leaders would need new materials, training on how to work with members, and other help by the first of  February. A planned executive committee meeting in October could \nhelp organize subcommittees to work on materials, assess where training was most needed, and arrange training meetings for leaders in December and January. Dick then considered what he had t o do before the week of January 17 (the week of planned and \npublicized project training meetings) if results were to be shown in improved project work by members in the coming year.  \nDick planned an information program for members, parents, and leaders for \nAugust or September. He got information from other states and counties on how they conducted training. He wrote to his state leader right away for her advice.  \n \n \n51", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e564e394-5bc1-4582-8500-9be8624212b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e564e394-5bc1-4582-8500-9be8624212b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b47cf76-d8cb-4c95-bcc6-00bed3ba6dd5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "d2b1b838b35255d3e38a3920aa3d4f9e2006b38341ef4a1d95a4e8b1d46a5caa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "45383b3b-c207-4d70-9921-f2420c4cedb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "3ed4ce698d5e89e2c4a247f970ac043a4844033ee8e7ba2695010b1a3f5116cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "227130ae-5e84-4a85-a2fc-e3efc0730a37", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "5bd0cc6e121ab8c7d83f87a0679c79d554c673356af12bd8ae27dc5d4f886696", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4183f4bbc159159e820f94d35ee141fc4df8bbc909b2d2262f5e33000946b51e", "text": "STEP 6:   Dick used his newsletters and 4 -H executive council \nCommitment   meetings to inform his members and leaders about plans for  \nto action on   improving project work and training.

His work was very intangible and ambiguous. \nsituation   Sometimes he wondered whether he was a regional Chamber of                                                        \n Commerce assistant, an Extension agent, or a specialist in business  \n or a half dozen other subjects.  \n  \nHe worked on regional planning, lakeshore improvement, industrial \ndevelopment, and pro curement of low -rent housing within many counties in his area. \nHowever, he tended to work on many projects in response to day -to-day requests. He \nwas concerned whether his activities really r esponded to the critical needs and issues \nin his eight -county area, or if he could make a more significant contribution by giving \nmore systematic attention to setting priorities.  \n \nHank saw the communities as most critical to his program's success. He got i nput \nabout broad societal concerns such as the economy, the environment, taxes, alienation, \nequal opportunity, and cultural opportunities, from mass media, conversations with political leaders, and his organization.  \n \nHank also needed input from the eight c ounties he worked in about their specific \nneeds and problems.  \n \nWithin these counties, specific groups such as Chambers of Commerce, town and \ncounty board members, industrial development boards, service clubs, Regional Planning Commission, civic groups, mun icipalities, small businesses, and \nenvironmental protection groups would need to be approached.  \n \nHis Extension sources of influence were sociologists, survey teams, economic \nspecialists, urban and regional planners, CRD program leaders, local Extension agents, recreation and leisure specialists.  \n \nHank felt he was the critical source of influence on his own role in CRD work,  but \nhe knew he had to depend heavily on others. As a facilitator between content specialists and agents in specific locales, he was the  channel between local problems and new \nresearch and ideas. He needed flexibility, adaptability, and concern for the needs of people.  \n \nSTEP 2:   Hank worked in a certain defined geographic area with county  \nIdentifying  Extension agents in designated counties . He decided he needed to  \nthe possible  approach several groups to get input. He talked with the six county  \npriorities  agents with whom he worked. Based on their general concerns, he  \n asked state program leaders and state specialists how they saw the  \n situation. The Extension specialists and leaders assured him they \nwould do all they could to provide back -up support to the programs identified as critical by \nthe communities he worked in. So Hank went back to the counties to solicit the concerns of \ncertain com munities as his own priorities.  \n \nHank and his agents decided to conduct a pilot effort within the next year to \nidentify a township and/or village in each county. Within each, they promoted a special town -problem identification meeting. At this meeting, Ha nk led the participants \nthrough the \"nominal group\" process. He asked the participants to form into groups of \n6-8 people each. He gave each person a card and each group large sheets of paper.  \n56", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d549a7f8-328d-481b-b348-8d165c7cd5f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d549a7f8-328d-481b-b348-8d165c7cd5f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5aee1b11-0e0a-404f-9035-cb11ac784db4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "2c4e67c901f4789725b60903c2b70f3669026ff0dae5676841539cd0a5697aa1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bcb2ff2d-9b0c-43a4-9b79-aa00016ab479", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "324ebb69f2feea32c42ba4c071e023be657019c1e3b490dda7e45a82dd354601", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a20402f-d9fb-4efe-a958-39cf0ba30833", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_path": "books\\First Things First\\stephen-covey-first-things-first.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12567653, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "1c0b27f5e56198b180d3558c9de1f0bda51814ec25b601663dc34f949505bd3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "facd938a689c09de43e3ffeacf4838a2e27520c380e8e615e7ba77ec39ca2374", "text": "He asked the participants to list on one side of their  cards what critical problems \nthey perceived in their community and on the other side what should be done about \nthe problem, or whether it was realistic to expect the problem to be solved.  \n \nThe ideas of individuals were later consolidated on paper, hung up  on walls, \ndiscussed, and voted on by the groups.

He put the concerns for \neach pa rticular community on a blackboard so the group could ask questions about \nthem, add to them, or revise them if they wished.  \n \nHe asked the group to look at the criteria, to ask questions until they understood \nthe list, and then to pick out the three that mo st seemed to represent community and \nsociety concerns.  \n \nThese votes were tallied and the top seven were put back on the board. Hank then \nreviewed the specific clientele criteria, and asked the group to ask questions to clarify \nthe possibilities. They were then asked to vote again as to which of the seven possible \npriorities left over from the first round best met their own specific criteria. The votes were tallied and the top five were put back on the board.  \n \nHank thanked the group for their selections and explained that their chosen high \npriorities would have to be put through two more filters: the Extension organization's and \nhis own, before he could select which ones he'd program on. He said he'd report his chosen program priorities back to them when they  were selected. Then he went home \nto pass the five top priority alternatives through the Extension screen and his own.  \n \nWhen he finished, the priorities were ranked in importance as follows:  \n1. Land use planning (Hank's No. 1 \npriority)  \n2. Urban sprawl  \n3. Waste disposal  \n4. Tax pressures on \nfarmers  \n5. Mass transportation  \n6. Growing population  \n7.

If results of  \npriorities:  any magnitude were to come from his work on land use planning and  \nconsequences  zoning, he would need more than merely a voice vote of influentials \nin \nand timing  a county. He tried to answer several other questions about his top \npriority:  \n \n1. Is the choice congruent with my efforts in other counties? (4 of 6 counties \nwere working on it -it was.)  \n2. Do the facts and hard data support it? (Data on taxes, population growth, \nsubdivisions, condemnations, and mixing of home and industrial sites support ed it.) \n3. Will urban land use planning support my other work? (He knew that the choice was an \"umbrella program\" for more specific concerns on pollution, preferential tax treatments for farmlands, industrial development, and urban sprawl.)  \n4. Was anything li kely to happen? Was the choice just a put -off with no likely \nconsequences?  \n \nOn this last question, he concluded, it was extremely timely for four of six \ncounties to deal with this topic. If they didn't, the consequences were very gloomy. Chaos and conflict s were likely in the future if individuals and communities didn't \nconsider land use choices now. \n \nNext came the question of timing.
