make a whole new preparation. Though\nevery signi\ufb01cant writing project I\u2019ve ever undertaken has reinforced this\nprinciple, it is so easy to forget. I began working on this book \ufb01ve years\nago thinking I could draw on my lifetime of study, teaching and\nconsulting in the \ufb01eld of leadership and \u201cwhip it out\u201d in a matter of a\nfew months. After more than a year of teaching the material and\nwriting, my team and I \ufb01nished an initial rough draft\u2014thrilled we had\n\ufb01nally arrived. It was at that moment we experienced what hikers often\ndiscover when climbing mountains: We hadn\u2019t reached the summit at\nall, only the top of the \ufb01rst rise. From this new vantage point of sweat-\nearned insights we could see things we had never seen before\u2014ones\nonly made visible at the top of that hill. So we set our sights on the\n\u201creal\u201d mountain and began the new climb.\nWe literally went through this same experience another dozen times,\neach time thinking we had \ufb01nally reached the \u201cpeak,\u201d each time\nconvinced that the book was \ufb01nally \u201cthere\u201d and each time being\nhumbled into the realization that we had only risen to yet another\ncritical level of insight, and that there was another mountain ahead.\nThe greatest and most inspiring mountain climbing achievements in\nhistory are not so much stories of individual achievement, but are\nstories of the extraordinary power of a uni\ufb01ed, talented, prepared team\nthat stays loyally committed to one another and to their shared vision to\nthe end. Most climbing teams that set out to climb Mount Everest never\nreach the summit\u2014only the very, very few.

I frequently ask large audiences, \u201cHow\nmany agree that the vast majority of the workforce in your organization\npossesses far more talent, intelligence, capability and creativity than\ntheir present jobs require or even allow?\u201d The overwhelming majority\nof the people raise their hands, and this is with groups all over the\nworld. About the same percentage acknowledge that they are under\nimmense pressure to produce more for less. Just think about it. People\nface a new and increasing expectation to produce more for less in a\nterribly complex world, yet they are simply not allowed to use a\nsigni\ufb01cant portion of their talents and intelligence.\nIn no way is this pain more clearly or practically manifest in\norganizations than in their inability to focus on and execute their highest\npriorities.

My answer is always the same: The greater the change and\nmore dif\ufb01cult the challenges, the more relevant they become. You see,\nthe 7 Habits are about becoming highly effective.

Now, spanning the planet\nvia Internet and Worldwide Web, this conversation is so vast, so\nmultifaceted, that trying to \ufb01gure out what it is about is futile. It\u2019s about a\nbillion years of pent up hopes and fears and dreams coded in serpentine\ndouble helixes, the collective \ufb02ashback d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of our strange perplexing\nspecies. Something ancient, elemental, sacred, something very, very funny\nthat\u2019s broken loose in the pipes and wires of the twenty-\ufb01rst century.\n. . . there are millions and millions of threads in this conversation, but\nat the beginning and end of each one is a human being.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nThis fervid desire for the Web bespeaks a longing so intense that it can\nonly be understood as spiritual. A longing indicates something is missing\nin our lives. What is missing is the sound of the human voice. The\nspiritual lure of the Web is the promise of the return of voice.2\nRather than further describe voice, let me illustrate it through the\ntrue story of one man. When I met Muhammad Yunus, founder of the\nGrameen Bank\u2014a  unique organization established for the sole purpose\nof extending microcredit to the poorest of the poor in Bangladesh\u2014I\nasked him when and how he had gained his vision. He said he didn\u2019t\nhave any vision to begin with. He simply saw someone in need, tried to\n\ufb01ll it, and the vision evolved. Muhammad Yunus\u2019s vision of a\npovertyfree world was set in motion with an event on the streets of\nBangladesh. While interviewing him for my syndicated column* on\nLeadership, he shared his story with me:\nIt all started twenty-\ufb01ve years ago. I was teaching economics at a university in\nBangladesh. The country was in the middle of a famine. I felt terrible. Here I was,\nteaching the elegant theories of economics in the classroom with all the enthusiasm\nof a brand-new Ph.D. from the United States. But I would walk out of the\nclassroom and see skeletons all around me, people waiting to die.\nI felt that whatever I had learned, whatever I was teaching, was all make-believe\nstories, with no meaning for people\u2019s lives.

I assumed a worm\u2019s-eye view, trying to \ufb01nd whatever comes\nright in front of you\u2014s mell it, touch it, see if you can do something about it.\nOne particular incident took me in a new direction. I met a woman who was\nmaking bamboo stools. After a long discussion, I found out that she made only two\nU.S. pennies each day. I couldn\u2019t believe anybody could work so hard and make such\nbeautiful bamboo stools yet make such a tiny amount of pro\ufb01t. She explained to me\nthat because she didn\u2019t have the money to buy the bamboo to make the stools, she\nhad to borrow from the trader\u2014and the trader imposed the condition that she had\nto sell the product to him alone, at a price that he decided.\nAnd that explains the two pennies\u2014she was virtually in bonded labor to this\nperson. And how much did the bamboo cost? She said, \u201cOh, about twenty cents. For\na very good one twenty-\ufb01ve cents.\u201d I thought, \u201cPeople suffer for twenty cents and\nthere is nothing anyone can do about it?\u201d I debated whether I should give her\ntwenty cents, but then I came up with another idea\u2014let me make a list of people\nwho needed that kind of money. I took a student of mine and we went around the\nvillage for several days and came up with a list of forty-two such people. When I\nadded up the total amount they needed, I got the biggest shock of my life: It added\nup to twenty-seven dollars! I felt ashamed of myself for being part of a society which\ncould not provide even twenty-seven dollars to forty-two hardworking, skilled\nhuman beings.\nTo escape that shame, I took the money out of my pocket and gave it to my\nstudent. I said, \u201cYou take this money and give it to those forty-two people that we\nmet and tell them this is a loan, but they can pay me back whenever they are able to.\nIn the meantime, they can sell their products wherever they can get a good price.\u201d\nAll that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.3\nEDMUND BURKE\nAfter receiving the money, they were very excited. And seeing that excitement\nmade me think, \u201cWhat do I do now?\u201d I thought of the bank branch which was\nlocated on the campus of the university, and I went to the manager and suggested\nthat he lend money to the poor people that I had met in the village.

They cannot offer collateral, and such a tiny amount is not worth\nlending.\u201d He suggested that I see the high of\ufb01cials in the banking hierarchy in\nBangladesh.\nI took his advice and went to the people who matter in the banking section.\nEverybody told me the same thing. Finally, after several days of running around, I\noffered myself as a guarantor. \u201cI\u2019ll guarantee the loan, I\u2019ll sign whatever they want\nme to sign, and they can give me the money and I\u2019ll give it to the people that I want\nto.\u201d\nSo that was the beginning. They warned me repeatedly that the poor people who\nreceive the money will never pay it back. I said, \u201cI\u2019ll take a chance.\u201d And the\nsurprising thing was, they repaid me every penny. I got very excited and came to the\nmanager and said, \u201cLook, they pay back, there\u2019s no problem.\u201d But he said, \u201cOh, no,\nthey\u2019re just fooling you. Soon they will take more money and never pay you back.\u201d\nSo I gave them more money, and they paid me back. I told this to him, but he said,\n\u201cWell, maybe you can do it in one village, but if you do it in two villages it won\u2019t\nwork.\u201d And I hurriedly did it in two villages\u2014and it worked.\nSo it became a kind of struggle between me and the bank manager and his\ncolleagues in the highest positions. They kept saying that a larger number, \ufb01ve\nvillages probably, will show it. So I did it in \ufb01ve villages, and it only showed that\neverybody paid back. Still they didn\u2019t give up. They said, \u201cTen villages. Fifty\nvillages. One hundred villages.\u201d And so it became a kind of contest between them\nand me. I came up with results they could not deny because it was their money I was\ngiving, but they would not accept it because they are trained to believe that poor\npeople are not reliable. Luckily, I was not trained that way so I could believe\nwhatever I was seeing, as it revealed itself. But the bankers\u2019 minds, their eyes were\nblinded by the knowledge they had.\nFinally, I had the thought, Why am I trying to convince them? I am totally\nconvinced that poor people can take money and pay it back. Why don\u2019t we set up a\nseparate bank? That excited me, and I wrote down the proposal and went to the\ngovernment to get the permission to set up a bank.

More importantly,\nyou\u2019d need a new mind-set\u2014a new way of thinking. The fact is that the\nfactory of the Industrial Age produced \ufb01fty times more than the family\nfarm, and over time, 90 percent of the farmers were downsized. Those\nwho survived in farming took the Industrial Age concept and created\nthe industrialized farm. Today, only 3 percent of the people in the\nUnited States are farmers, who produce most of the food for the entire\ncountry and much of the world.\nDo you believe that the Information/Knowledge Worker Age we\u2019re\nmoving into will outproduce the Industrial Age \ufb01fty times? I believe it\nwill. We\u2019re just barely beginning to see it. It will outproduce it \ufb01fty\ntimes\u2014not twice, not three or ten times, but \ufb01fty. Nathan Myhrvold,\nformer chief technology of\ufb01cer at Microsoft, puts it this way: \u201cThe top\nsoftware developers are more productive than average software\ndevelopers not by a factor of 10X or 100X or even 1000X but by\n10,000X.\u201d\nQuality knowledge work is so valuable that unleashing its potential\noffers organizations an extraordinary opportunity for value creation. If\nthat is true, just think of the value of unleashing the potential of your\nchildren. Knowledge work leverages all of the other investments that an\norganization or a family has already made. In fact, knowledge workers\nare the link to all of the organization\u2019s other investments. They provide\nfocus, creativity, and leverage in utilizing those investments to better\nachieve the organization\u2019s objectives.\nDo you believe the Knowledge Worker Age will eventually bring\nabout a downsizing of up to 90 percent of the Industrial Age workforce?\nI believe it. Current outsourcing and unemployment trends are just the\ntip of the iceberg.

You might be\ntempted to blame the problem on Mr. Harold, but notice that his boss\ntreats him just the same way he treats Max. Such insulting\nmicromanaging is endemic throughout the whole company. The whole\nculture is codependent.

There is a fundamental lack of trust, and many lack the\nskill and mind-set to work out their differences in authentic, creative\nways. Though organizational systems and controlling management\npractices do much to foster this codependency, the problem is\ncompounded by the fact that so many people have been raised being\ncompared to others at home and competing against others in school, in\nathletics and in the workplace. These powerful in\ufb02uences cultivate a\nscarcity mentality, so that many people have a hard time being\ngenuinely happy for the successes of others.\nAt the personal level, these organizations are \ufb01lled with bright,\ntalented, creative people at every level who feel straitjacketed,\nundervalued and uninspired.

But if you want\nto make signi\ufb01cant, quantum improvement, work on paradigms. The\nword paradigm stems from the Greek word paradeigma, originally a\nscienti\ufb01c term but commonly used today to mean a perception,\nassumption, theory, frame of reference or lens through which you view\nthe world. It\u2019s like a map of a territory or city. If inaccurate, it will make\nno difference how hard you try to \ufb01nd your destination or how\npositively you think\u2014y ou\u2019ll stay lost.

Several years ago, our \ufb01rm participated\nwith our local PBS station in broadcasting a video dramatization we\ndeveloped and \ufb01lmed in England. The central \ufb01gure in this remarkable\nstory is an Englishman who transcended a childhood spent as a street\nurchin to become a reasonably successful writer with a nice home and a\nloving family. At the time of the story, however, he had developed\n\u201cwriter\u2019s block.\u201d It seemed his creativity had turned off. His debts were\nmounting. He was under tremendous deadline pressure from the\npublisher. He was becoming more and more depressed. He began to\nfear that his own children would end up on the streets like so many he\nsaw around, like he, himself, had as a youth\u2014particularly when his\nfather was in debtor\u2019s prison.\nHe was discouraged. He couldn\u2019t sleep. He began to spend his nights\nwalking the streets of London. He saw the poverty, the inhumane\nconditions of children working nights in the factories, the terrible\nstruggle of parents trying to eke out a living for their families.\nGradually, the full reality of what he was seeing began to hit him\u2014the\nimpact of sel\ufb01shness and greed and those who would take advantage of\nothers. An idea touched his heart and began to grow in his mind. There\nwas something he could do that would make a difference!\nHe returned to his writing with an energy and enthusiasm he had\nnever known. The vision of contribution impassioned and consumed\nhim. He no longer felt doubt or discouragement. He didn\u2019t worry\nabout his own \ufb01nancial concerns. He wanted to get this story out, to\nmake it as inexpensive as possible, to make it available to as many\npeople as possible. His whole life had changed. He\u2019d truly found his\nvoice.\nI invite you now to watch a brief \ufb01lm that dramatizes this\nremarkable man\u2019s true experience. You can view it by going to\nwww.The8thHabit.com/offers and selecting Discovery of a Character from\nthe Films menu.\nINSPIRE OTHERS TO FIND THEIR VOICE", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "595bf7c0-98dc-4229-a11e-5d634c17080e": {"__data__": {"id_": "595bf7c0-98dc-4229-a11e-5d634c17080e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dc2a1493-ef1e-4ec1-a51d-cbc421a08fd6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "286dd30e2c45be6129e215170f960245f292aec5fb110dcb9c3b33dce1d2e9a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "92b39746-0423-4a5b-ab00-fd59daf70c4d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "2c261b2a0ef9e069d57cd451f33756b2d916b9a8604745775f65ca35bf49036d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "65baede8-07b9-435d-8a3b-30dc20d64246", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "6e14c7f48c1619164955051aa1900088ef1f67579b33de99ff97910fe38b9a61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d20e888302b41d42efbeccc04d93d92e33c06ef56daa681081ed372678a79488", "text": "Once you\u2019ve found your own voice, the choice to expand your in\ufb02uence,\nto increase your contribution, is the choice to inspire others to \ufb01nd\ntheir voice.

He taught a one-semester\nclass for faculty entitled How to Improve Your Teaching. The essence\nof his program was this great principle: The best way to get people to learn is\nto turn them into teachers. In other words, you learn the material best\nwhen you teach it.\nI immediately started to apply that principle in my work and at\nhome. When I \ufb01rst started university teaching, my classes only had\nabout \ufb01fteen to thirty students. When I started applying Dr. Gong\u2019s\nprinciple, I found that I could effectively teach many more students; in\nfact, some of my classes were packed with nearly a thousand students,\nand yet the students\u2019 performance and test scores actually went up.\nWhy? When you teach you simply learn better. Every student becomes\na teacher, and every teacher a student.\nNow, the common paradigm is that the teacher-student ratio is\ncritical\u2014fewer students means higher-quality teaching. But if you turn\nyour students into teachers, you gain leverage. You move the fulcrum\nover.\nAlso when you teach or share what you\u2019re learning with others, you\nimplicitly commit socially to live what you teach. You will naturally be\nmore motivated to live what you\u2019re learning. This sharing will be a\nbasis for deepening learning, commitment and motivation, making\nchange legitimate, and enrolling a support team. You will also \ufb01nd that\nsharing creates bonding with people\u2014especially with your children.\nHave them regularly teach you what they are learning in school.

To learn and not to do is not to\nlearn. In other words, to understand something but not apply it is really\nnot to understand it. It is only in the doing, the applying, that knowledge\nand understanding are internalized. For instance, you could study\ntennis as a sport by reading books and hearing lectures, but until you\u2019ve\nactually played it, you wouldn\u2019t really know the sport. To know and not\nto do is not to know.\nSelf-knowledge is best learned, not by contemplation, but by action. Strive\nto do your duty and you will soon discover of what stuff you are made.\nJOHANN GOETHE\nThere are at least four approaches you could take in applying what\nyou learn in this book:\n1.\u00a0The \ufb01rst would be to simply read the book straight through.\nThen decide what you want to apply in your life and work.\nThis is the way most people approach a book. It re\ufb02ects the\ndesire many of us have to get emotionally or mentally\nconnected with a \ufb02ow of ideas in a book and then run with it.\n2.\u00a0The second approach would be to read through the entire book\nand then use the comprehensive understanding and cumulative\nmotivation to go back and read the book a second time\u2014this\ntime with the intent to apply as you go. This could work very\nwell for many.\n3.\u00a0A third approach\u2014one that I personally believe will yield the\ngreatest results\u2014would be to adopt it as a yearlong personal\ngrowth and development program. Take a month for each of the\nremaining twelve chapters. Start by reading the next chapter,\nteach it and then apply it the rest of the month. You will \ufb01nd\nthat if you will actually seek to apply what you learn in each\nchapter for a month, the insight you gain in the chapters that\nfollow will profoundly increase.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5918a021-96e0-48a2-8db3-db49714371d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "5918a021-96e0-48a2-8db3-db49714371d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4a43291-83e1-4028-a97a-b2ff87521083", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "571ecffa0ab129e1e16f20b3075faa1ec44fbae5e6002cd0b89a5c48cf20885d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "39a59a08-9cfa-4e30-9fdf-8424b5eac431", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "a6a2a423d107bef6001f814ae824354d5666e35f73f880799399f0c9a45cc1d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "37c90c94-f80e-43be-ade1-f526ee8f9b5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "7d16dd939afd95fa629bdab94c02c63e95ada5ae9a31171a78ca98595c8993b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a8e6aa079290c9e56325d86ecb5fc7768592408e0bca4bdfadb2158bd59c7745", "text": "4.\u00a0The fourth approach is simply to adapt the third approach to\nyour own timeline.

With others, due\nto various genetic and environmental in\ufb02uences, it may be very small.\nBut the key point is, there is still a space there and it is in the use of that\nspace that the opportunity to enlarge it exists.

Read, think about, and then reread\nthis quotation:\nThe range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice.\nAnd because we fail to notice that we fail to notice, there is little we can do\nto change; until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and\ndeeds.\nAn awareness of our freedom and power to choose is af\ufb01rming\nbecause it can excite our sense of possibility and potential. It can also\nthreaten, even terrify, because suddenly we\u2019re responsible, that is,\n\u201cresponse-able.\u201d We become accountable. If we\u2019ve taken shelter over\nthe years in explaining our situation and problems in the name of past\nor present circumstances, it is truly terrifying to think otherwise.\nSuddenly, there is no excuse.\nNo matter what has happened, is now happening, or will happen,\nthere is a space between those things and our responses to them.

Our body is a\nbrilliant piece of machinery that outperforms even the most advanced\ncomputer. Our capacity to act on our thoughts and feelings, and to\nmake things happen, is unmatched by any other species in the world.\nControlled double-blind scienti\ufb01c laboratory studies are producing\nincreasing evidence of the close relationship between body (physical),\nmind (thinking) and heart (feeling).\nPlaque seen in a rural store in North Carolina:\nThe brain said, \u201cI\u2019m the smartest organ in the body.\u201d The heart said, \u201cWho\ntold you?\u201d7\nEmotional Intelligence (EQ)\nEmotional Intelligence (EQ) is one\u2019s self-knowledge, self-awareness, social\nsensitivity, empathy and ability to communicate successfully with\nothers. It is a sense of timing and social appropriateness, and having the\ncourage to acknowledge weaknesses and express and respect differences.\nPrior to the nineties, when EQ became a hot topic, it was sometimes\ndescribed as right-brain capacity, as distinguished from left-brain\ncapacity. The left brain was considered the more analytic, the site of\nlinear thinking, language, reasoning and logic; the right brain, the more\ncreative, the site of intuition, sensing and holistics.

Combining thinking and feeling creates better\nbalance, judgment and wisdom.\nIntuition will tell the thinking mind where to look next.\nDR. JONAS SALK, DISCOVERER OF THE POLIO VACCINE\nThere has been a great deal of research suggesting that in the long\nrun, emotional intelligence is a more accurate determinant of successful\ncommunications, relationships and leadership than is mental\nintelligence. Author and EQ authority Daniel Goleman says this:\nFor star performance in all jobs, in every \ufb01eld, emotional competence is\ntwice as important as purely cognitive abilities. For success at the highest\nlevels, in leadership positions, emotional competence accounts for\nvirtually the entire advantage.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Given that emotional competencies\nmake up two-thirds or more of the ingredients of a standout\nperformance, the data suggests that \ufb01nding people who have these\nabilities, or nurturing them in existing employees, adds tremendous value\nto an organization\u2019s bottom line. How much? In simple jobs like machine\noperators or clerks, those in the top 1 percent with emotional competency\nwere three times more productive (by value). For jobs of medium\ncomplexity, like sales clerks, or mechanics, a single top emotional\ncompetent person was twelve times more productive (by value).8\nThe theory of emotional intelligence is destabilizing to people who\nhave anchored their strategy for success on sheer mental intelligence. A\nperson, for example, may be a ten on a ten-point IQ scale but\nemotionally score only a two, and not know how to relate well with\nothers. They may compensate for this de\ufb01ciency by over-relying on\ntheir intellect and borrowing strength from their formal position. But\nin so doing, they often exacerbate their own weaknesses and, in their\ninteractions, the weaknesses of others as well.

There\nare numerous books and an entire body of literature. Different words\nare sometimes used to describe the same things. Part of what I call\nspiritual intelligence some people may call emotional intelligence, and\nvice versa. I fully acknowledge this semantics dif\ufb01culty. Again, I\nencourage you, the reader, to not get hung up on word de\ufb01nitions but\nto search continuously for the underlying meaning.\nHoward Gardner\u2019s book on the theory of multiple intelligences,\nFrames of Mind, is a brilliant treatment of the concept of separate, yet\noverlapping, intelligences. I\u2019ve also gained greatly from both Robert\nCooper\u2019s and Daniel Goleman\u2019s work on emotional intelligence. I have\nheard their presentations in different settings and know that their\napproaches are research-based and comprehensive, and include some of\nthe elements I\u2019ve spoken about under spiritual intelligence.\nSome books separate out visual intelligence from verbal, analytical,\nartistic, logical, creative, economic and other intelligences. I appreciate\ntheir contributions but again believe you can put them all under the\nfour areas of body, mind, heart and spirit\u2014the four dimensions of life.\nI\u2019ll never forget an experience in Hawaii with the Young Presidents\u2019\nOrganization.

It is based\non a false paradigm or map of human nature, that of determinism. We\nare a product of neither nature nor nurture; we are a product of choice,\nbecause there is always a space between stimulus and response. As we\nwisely exercise our power to choose based on principles, the space will\nbecome larger. Little children and people who are mentally\nhandicapped may not have that space, but the overwhelming majority\nof adults do. Determinism is deeply imbedded into present-day culture\nand is reinforced by the terrifying sense that if I do have choice, then I\nam also responsible for my present situation. Until a person can\nhonestly say \u201cI am what I am\u201d and \u201cI am where I am because I so choose\nto be there,\u201d that person cannot say with conviction, \u201cI choose\notherwise.\u201d\nQ: Are leaders born or made, meaning environmentally\nconditioned and trained?\nA: Again, this question is based on a false dichotomy, a \ufb02awed\nparadigm of determinism. Because of the space between stimulus and\nresponse, people have the power of choice; therefore, leaders are neither\nborn nor made\u2014meaning environmentally trained and nurtured. They\nare self-made through chosen responses, and if they choose based on\nprinciples and develop increasingly greater discipline, their freedom to\nchoose increases. In the book Geeks and Geezers: How Era, Values, and\nDe\ufb01ning Moments Shape Leaders, authors Warren G. Bennis and Robert J.\nThomas make the case that leaders are made, not born.17 The basic\nconcept is that because of one intense transformational experience, they\nmake those choices that enable them to become a leader. Dr. Noel\nTichy also basically says that leaders aren\u2019t born, they are taught. Again,\nthe implication is that people make the choice to be taught and to follow\nthe teachings. In both instances, the authors are really saying that\nleaders aren\u2019t made or born, they are self-made\u2014leadership is a\nfunction of choices.\nQ: Must you develop all four capacities or intelligences?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eece25ec-8414-4d87-b2f9-7a667bdcb936": {"__data__": {"id_": "eece25ec-8414-4d87-b2f9-7a667bdcb936", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7a08877a-90aa-47df-a542-d44c3e952813", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "4f257819026322e1fced5b117e0df2a2f708b868451806c87c0ae2045f61e3b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3d3a739-7d53-49bb-9018-71bfbbdcd29c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "90ebe088ba8529f11e79ff1fddd61fb84bfe9a21b6b880b42c75516d69046d21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f29dbf7-473d-4b49-88ca-af9d1e6dc4b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "58e56ec568cc18f5d2654247dff720a1dfc499823c3df9e174bcad81f44739c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d336fee2952d0cf332d950bc9e2956b442a5d4036610f122a9de6d01a533207d", "text": "A: Yes, because you won\u2019t really be able to develop any one of them\nto its mature, sustainable level without working on all four.

She served three terms as prime minister of Great Britain, the\nlongest continuous premiership in the twentieth century. Her critics are\nnot few, but she was passionate about urging people to assume the\ndiscipline of personal responsibility and to build self-reliance, and she\nwas passionate about bolstering free enterprise in her country.

With my\nbody, mind and spirit fatigued beyond measure, I was motivated to \ufb01nd new\nmeaning in my life.\nI grabbed on to the idea that all things are created twice, \ufb01rst mentally and then\nphysically. I had to ask myself what talents I had. An aptitude assessment test\nclari\ufb01ed for me what my strongest abilities were. To create a sense of balance in my\nlife, I focused on the four parts of my nature. On an intellectual level, I realized that\nI loved to teach; spiritually and socially, I wanted to continue to support the racial\nharmony we had endeavored to create in our biracial marriage; emotionally, I knew\nI needed to give love. When my mother was alive she would rock critically ill babies\nin the hospital. I wanted to give comfort as she had and continue her legacy of\nunconditional love.\nI was afraid to fail, but I told myself it would be okay to try different things, like\ntrying on hats. If I didn\u2019t like teaching after a semester, I didn\u2019t have to go back. I\nbegan by going to graduate school so I could teach on the college level.

Because\neverything after that is just math.\u201d And after thinking for a while, he\nchanged his mind. He said, \u201cInstead I would ask, \u2018Why was the universe\ncreated?\u2019 Because then I would know the meaning of my own life.\u201d\nPerhaps the most important vision of all is to develop a sense of self,\na sense of your own destiny, a sense of your unique mission and role in\nlife, a sense of purpose and meaning. When testing your own personal\nvision \ufb01rst ask yourself: Does the vision tap into my voice, my energy,\nmy unique talent? Does it give me a sense of \u201ccalling,\u201d a cause worthy\nof my commitment? Acquiring such meaning requires profound\npersonal re\ufb02ection, asking deep questions and envisioning.\nThe author, \ufb01lmmaker and world-renowned storyteller Sir Laurens\nvan der Post said, \u201cWithout vision we all suffer from an insuf\ufb01ciency of\ndata. We look at life myopically, that is, through our own lens, our own\nworld. Vision enables us to transcend our autobiography, our past to\nrise above our memory.

I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have the freedom to play the\npiano. I never disciplined myself. I preferred playing with my friends to\npracticing, as my parents and piano teacher wanted me to do. I don\u2019t\nthink I ever envisioned myself as a piano player. I never had a sense of\nwhat it might mean, a kind of freedom to create magni\ufb01cent art that\nmight be valuable to myself and to others throughout my entire life.\nWhat about the freedom to forgive, to ask forgiveness?

Again, sacri\ufb01ce really means giving\nup something good for something better. But in the mind of the person\nsacri\ufb01cing, there really is no sacri\ufb01ce\u2014only to the observer is it\nsacri\ufb01ce.\nSacri\ufb01ce can take many forms as it manifests itself in the four\ndimensions of our lives: making physical and economic sacri\ufb01ces (the\nbody); cultivating an open, inquisitive mind and purging oneself of\nprejudices (the mind); showing deep respect and love to others (the\nheart); and subordinating one\u2019s own will to a higher will for the greater\ngood (the spirit).\nA new philosophy, a new way of life, is not given for nothing. It has to be\npaid dearly for and only acquired with much patience and great effort.\nFYODOR DOSTOEVSKY\nConscience teaches us that ends and means are inseparable, that ends\nactually preexist in the means.

I\nwas a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions, until I read the\nlast one: What is the \ufb01rst name of the woman who cleans the school?\nSurely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times.\nShe was tall, dark-haired and in her \ufb01fties, but how would I know her name? I\nhanded in my paper, leaving the last question blank.\nBefore the class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward\nour quiz grade. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said the professor. \u201cIn your careers you will meet\nmany people. All are signi\ufb01cant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all\nyou do is smile and say hello.\u201d\nI\u2019ve never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.11\nWhen people strive to live by their conscience, it produces integrity and peace\nof mind.

They will \ufb01nd their ego\nattempting to control relationships. Even though they might pretend\nor feign kindness and empathy from time to time, they will use subtle\nforms of manipulation and will even go so far as to engage in kind but\ndictatorial behavior.\nThe private victory of integrity is the foundation for the public\nvictories of establishing a common vision, discipline and passion.\nLeadership becomes an interdependent work rather than an immature\ninterplay between strong, independent, ego-driven rulers and\ncompliant, dependent followers.\nFILM: Stone\nThere is a man in Uganda who beautifully illustrates the power of\nallowing conscience to wisely direct our vision, discipline and passion.\nHis name is Stone, and he was a great soccer player. The dream of every\nkid in Uganda is to become good enough at soccer that the European\nclubs will sign him or her as a player. The big, serious money from\nEurope was looking at Stone, when, during a game, somebody\npurposely hit him in a way that \u201cblew out\u201d his knee. His professional\ncareer was over.\nStone could have become vindictive or revengeful. He could have\nwallowed in self-pity or lived in his celebrity for the rest of his life. But\nhe didn\u2019t. Instead he chose his response. He used his imagination\n(vision) and his conscience to inspire and in\ufb02uence young \u201cproblem\u201d\nUgandan boys and teenagers who would otherwise be lost in life with\nno marketable skills, no role models, and no hope.\nI would like to invite you to see Stone in action. I want you to feel\nhis spirit, and to sense his heart and vision.

Oftentimes, getting into shape merely means replacing fat with\nmuscle, which may actually increase your weight since muscle weighs\nabout twice as much as fat. Nevertheless, our fundamental task is to get\ninto shape and become physically healthy, strong and \ufb01t. That is the\nvision. What is the discipline? Usually it involves a strict regimen of\nexercise, proper nutrition, rest and stress management. Passion\nrepresents the depth of feeling, the emotional commitment, and the\ndrive.

Before making a bad food choice,\ntrain yourself to inwardly say: \u201cMy temptation is emotional, and\nresisting will further my needed weight loss and strengthen my\ncharacter. Furthermore, nothing tastes as good as thin feels.\u201d\nIt is very common to become discouraged by the cycle of setting a\ngoal to lose weight, and then abandoning it within days or even hours.\nMany complain, \u201cI\u2019m just not disciplined.\u201d My experience is that the\nbiggest problem is not the discipline; it\u2019s that we have not yet paid the\nprice with vision\u2014we\u2019re also not yet connected with our deepest values\nand motivations (conscience), with those things most important to us.\nLet me illustrate with the experience of a friend of mine:\nI had been working very hard on my career. By the time I turned forty-\ufb01ve, I was\nquite successful. I was also about sixty pounds overweight, a compulsive eater\nduring times of stress, and one who didn\u2019t have time to exercise regularly because of\nwork. On his \ufb01fth birthday, my son, Logan, gave me a book on healthy living.\nInside, his mother had helped him write the following words: \u201cDaddy, for my\nbirthday this year, I want you to be healthy. I want you to be around a while.\u201d Talk\nabout a punch in the gut. Ouch.\nThat plea from my son changed my perspective on my lifestyle completely. The\neating and the lack of regular physical exercise weren\u2019t just my individual choice\nanymore. I saw suddenly that I was creating a very unhealthy legacy for my\nchildren. I was modeling for them that one\u2019s body was unimportant, that self-\ncontrol was unimportant, that the only thing worth working hard for in this life\nwas money and prestige. I realized that my stewardship to my children involved\nmore than just providing for their physical, \ufb01nancial and emotional needs. It also\ninvolved providing healthy role models on which they could pattern their lives. I had\nnot been doing that.\nSo I committed myself to being healthy for my children. Not to losing weight,\nbut to being healthy. That\u2019s the key for me. My commitment had to be to something\nthat held real value for me. I had tried so many diets and exercise programs before.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8a19e02-ab43-4577-ac6d-ab61d27340c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8a19e02-ab43-4577-ac6d-ab61d27340c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d8ddf53c-85eb-43a3-a964-8de738a2fa24", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "6f9e3adc407981e2602b10348765cfa3338bcba0b08bb1449162534d76d7dd81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1262a086-1fbd-493f-b998-3bbfd5d34d8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "14895726500626d87d8cf0e9191de92de078fa2e7ea95b0626b471a08fec05db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee8c3f78-615e-43ed-b3cc-35ad9a154561", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "fbfc343c0bfcbef738406dfdf545116d2925df9644c639736e132871ac4447e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ac13f1b4dc1e16f9794c4c8f3f92623f434afdce7858f54a4b8ca39036edffde", "text": "Normally I would be \ufb01ne until stresses happened in my life. To have losing weight\nas my inspiring motivation was simply not enough. But my children are signi\ufb01cant\nenough. I care enough about them that I can choose to make healthy decisions. I\nestablished as a goal for myself that I wanted to be healthy. I wanted to be vital, to\nhave energy to play with my kids after work, to be able to play in the company\nsoftball tournament without getting winded on the way to \ufb01rst base. As a way to\nreach that goal, I implemented a diet and exercise program. The key here is that the\ndiet and exercise program was not the goal. Being healthy for my children was. I\ndecided to share my goal with somebody else who wanted to be healthy. We now\nwork together on an exercise program. I made sure I set aside time for me to\naccomplish my goals. I learned to know when to stop working and to pay attention\nto the needs of my body.\nIt\u2019s been two years since I changed my way of thinking. I don\u2019t struggle anymore\nto get out of bed. Exercising has almost become second nature. I don\u2019t talk myself\nout of my exercise program like I did at the beginning. Sure, there are still days that\nI don\u2019t do too well. I think I\u2019m tired, I think my hamstring is strained, I have a\nheadache, it\u2019s too hot. Some days, I plain talk myself out of running. But it\u2019s so much\neasier now for me to get back on track. Because I have this larger goal, this greater\ncommitment to somebody I love more than myself, I can get right back on track.\nQ: What about getting a job?\nA: Getting into shape is primarily an independent effort. Getting the\njob you want is clearly a highly interdependent one and relies on\neffective development of in\ufb02uence with other people.\nNow, let\u2019s think through how to get the job you want by looking at\nthe same four attributes of personal in\ufb02uence: vision, discipline, passion\nand conscience. The key is all four. Neglect any one of them and you\u2019ll\n\ufb01nd it much more dif\ufb01cult to get the job you want, and if you do get it,\nyou will likely not be able to sustain what you committed to and what\nit requires of you.\nLet\u2019s assume there\u2019s a very soft job market and that most employers\nare letting people go, not hiring\u2014particularly in the industry and city\nwhere you want to live and work.

People tend to focus so much on\nwork and other pressing activities that the relationships and activities\nthey really treasure most end up getting squeezed and pushed aside.\nThey end up becoming addicted to urgency.\nLet me illustrate a solution with the story of a man who got caught\nup in this whirlpool of urgency. Notice that he took time to think about\nwhat mattered most to him (conscience, vision and passion), and then\nused those criteria to creatively decide how to organize his life to be in\nharmony with his priorities (discipline) and create the life balance he\ndesired. Notice also how the solution came through synergy with his\nwife. Here is his true story told in his own words:\nI have always had a special friendship with my mother. Together we endured a\nseries of life events, which has created a wonderful relationship. At one time in my\nlife, even though I loved my mother and really enjoyed spending time with her, I got\ncaught up in my commitments to work, the community, and to my own family. My\nlife got so busy, weeks would go by before I would make even a quick phone call just\nto check in. And when I did manage to squeeze in a visit, we would have just sat\ndown to talk, and it would be time for me to leave. Another meeting to go to,\nanother deadline to meet.

I knew my life was out of control if I couldn\u2019t consistently spend\ntime with my mother. So, my wife and I brainstormed for a solution. She suggested\nscheduling a time each week or so that would work for both our family and my\nmother. When we looked at the calendar, we saw my wife has choir practice every\nWednesday evening. That night became my night to spend with my mom.\nNow my mom knows that every week or two I will be coming on a speci\ufb01c\nnight, at a speci\ufb01c time. I won\u2019t be running off within the \ufb01rst ten minutes, and\nthere are few interruptions. If she wants to get some exercise, we go for a walk\ntogether. Other times she\u2019ll cook a meal for me. Sometimes I take her shopping at the\nmall, which is further away than she feels comfortable driving to. No matter what\nwe do, we always talk\u2014about family, about current events, about memories.\nEvery evening I spend with my mother is a peaceful oasis in my busy life. I tell\nmy wife it\u2019s one of the best suggestions she\u2019s ever given me.\nThis beautiful little story is just one illustration of what can be done\nwhen we focus our hearts and minds upon what truly matters and then\nlive with integrity to do it. When my own father died, I decided I was\ngoing to maintain and even increase my very special relationship with\nmy mother because of the new void in her life. I resolved that despite a\nvery heavy travel schedule and no matter where I was, I would phone\nher every day for the rest of her life. Though we lived \ufb01fty miles apart, I\nwould also make special efforts to visit her at least every two weeks. She\nlived for another ten years and I cannot begin to express the depth of\nmy gratitude for her life and for the preciousness of our time together.\nI learned that when you regularly communicate with another person,\nyou reach a new level of understanding that almost runs by nuance. I\nfound that the daily phone call was not too unlike our semiweekly visit;\nwe felt as close to each other and as open and authentic with each other\nas we did when we were together. It was like one continuous\nconversation. It really didn\u2019t make much difference whether it was on\nthe phone or face-to-face, which surprised me, because I\u2019d always\nthought nothing could replace face-to-face contact.

We should all be thankful\nfor those people who rekindle the inner spirit.\nALBERT SCHWEITZER\nW HEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN, I had an experience with a leader that\nprofoundly shaped the rest of my life. I had decided to take a break in\nmy education to give some extended volunteer service. The invitation\ncame to go to England. Just four and one-half months after my arrival,\nthe president of the organization came to me and said, \u201cI have a new\nassignment for you. I want you to travel around the country and train\nlocal leaders.\u201d I was shocked. Who was I to train leaders two and three\ntimes my age? Sensing my doubt, he simply looked me in the eye and\nsaid, \u201cI have great con\ufb01dence in you. You can do this. I will give you\nmaterials to help you prepare to teach these leaders and to facilitate\ntheir sharing best practices with one another.\u201d\nHis con\ufb01dence, his ability to see more in me than I saw in myself, his\nwillingness to entrust me with responsibility that would stretch me to\nmy potential unlocked something inside me. I accepted the assignment\nand gave my best. It tapped me physically, mentally, emotionally,\nspiritually. I grew. I saw others grow. I saw patterns in basic leadership\nprinciples. By the time I returned home, I had begun to detect the work\nI wanted to devote my life to: unleashing human potential.

We could call this the Leadership Challenge.\nIn short, an organization is made up of individuals who have a\nrelationship and a shared purpose. You can see, then, how this\norganizational application applies to each one of us.\nMANAGEMENT AND/OR LEADERSHIP?\nLiterally hundreds of books and thousands of articles have come out in\nthe last few years on leadership. This points out how vital the subject is.\nLeadership really is the enabling art. The purpose of schools is\neducating kids, but if you have bad leadership, you have bad education.\nThe purpose of medicine is helping people get well, but if you have bad\nleadership, you\u2019ll have bad medicine. We could give illustration after\nillustration to show that leadership is the highest of the arts, simply\nbecause it enables all the other arts and professions to work. This is\nparticularly true for a family.\nI\u2019ve spent a lifetime studying, teaching and writing on both\nleadership and management. In fact, as a part of my preparation for\nwriting this book, I initiated a literature review of leadership theories of\nthe twentieth century.

We need context to understand ourselves.\nAs mentioned earlier, all organizations, even the best of them, are\nabsolutely \ufb01lled with problems. I\u2019ve worked with thousands. Even the\norganizations I admire most struggle to some degree. And the\ninteresting thing is that most of the problems are about the same.\nCertainly, there are unique personalities and circumstances connected\nto the problems. But when it comes right down to it, at the core, most\nproblems have common roots. Peter Drucker put it this way:\nThere are of course differences in management between different\norganizations\u2014m issions de\ufb01ne strategy after all and strategy de\ufb01nes\nstructure. But the differences between managing a chain of retail stores\nand managing a Roman Catholic Diocese are amazingly fewer than\nretail executives or bishops realize. The differences are mainly in the\napplication rather than principles. The executives of all these\norganizations spend for instance about the same amount of time on\npeople problems\u2014and the people problems are almost always the same.\nWhether you are managing a software company, a hospital, a bank, or\na Boy Scout organization, the differences apply to only about 10 percent\nof your work. This 10 percent is determined by the organization\u2019s speci\ufb01c\nmission, its speci\ufb01c culture, its speci\ufb01c history, and its speci\ufb01c vocabulary.\nThe rest is pretty much interchangeable.1\nMy goal in Part 2: Inspire Others to Find Their Voice is to help you\ndiscover how, by working and struggling to solve your personal\nchallenges and problems, you can greatly increase your own in\ufb02uence\nand the in\ufb02uence of your organization\u2014whether it be your team,\ndepartment, division or entire organization, including your family.\nLet\u2019s begin by looking \ufb01rst at the dual nature of the problems we\nface.

Organizations must constantly develop better ways of\ncompeting against lower labor prices, lower material costs, faster\ninnovation, greater ef\ufb01ciency and higher quality. The forces of\nfree enterprise and competition are driving quality up, driving\ncost down and driving increased speed and \ufb02exibility in order to\ndo the job the customer has hired us to do. No one can afford to\nsimply benchmark against competitors or even so-called\nexcellence; we must benchmark against \u201cworld class.\u201d\n\u2022 The Movement of Wealth Creation from Financial Capital to Intellectual\nand Social Capital: The wealth-creation movement has gone from\nmoney to people\u2014from \ufb01nancial capital to the summary notion\nof human capital (both intellectual and social), which includes all\ndimensions. More than two-thirds of the value added to today\u2019s\nproducts comes from knowledge work; twenty years ago it was less\nthan one-third.\n\u2022 Free Agency: People are becoming more and more informed, aware\nand conscious of options and alternatives than ever before.

Treating these acute problems may mask the underlying chronic\ncondition.\nSeveral years ago I had a fascinating experience that illustrates this\npoint.

If the spirit, or\nconscience, is consistently neglected throughout an organization, what\nproblem will result? Think about it. What happens in relationships\nwhen people are treated or act in ways contrary to their conscience?\nWon\u2019t an obvious loss of trust result? Low trust is the \ufb01rst chronic\nproblem that all organizations face. What would its acute\nmanifestations be? Low-trust organizations that operate in tough\nmarket conditions are \ufb01lled with the acute, painful symptoms of\nbackbiting, in-\ufb01ghting, victimism, defensiveness, information hoarding,\nand defensive, protective communication.*\nSecond, what chronic problem results when you neglect the mind or\nvision in an organization? You will have no shared vision or common value\nsystem. Under these conditions, what symptomatic behavior would you\nexpect to see? You would see people acting with hidden agendas,\nplaying political games, and using different criteria in decision making.\nYou would see an ambiguous, chaotic culture.\nThird, what problem results in an organization when there is\nwidespread neglect of discipline in the body politic (skeletal structure,\nsystems, processes)? In other words, what condition would you expect\nto see when there is no execution or systemic support behind the\npriorities of the organization? There will simply be no alignment or\ndiscipline built into the organization\u2019s structures, systems, processes and\nculture. When managers possess inaccurate and incomplete paradigms\nof human nature, they design systems\u2014including communication,\nrecruiting, selecting, placing, accountability, reward and compensation,\npromotion, training and development and information systems\u2014that\nfail to draw out the full potential of people.

They are simultaneous in the sense that once\nthe culture based on this leadership has been established, one must pay\nconstant attention to all four processes, all four roles.\nI would like to illustrate the signi\ufb01cance of sequence in these four\nroles by comparing it to professional sports, where, like the business\nworld, competition is very intense. When a player goes to professional\ntraining camp out of shape\u2014lacking muscle strength and cardiovascular\nendurance\u2014he is simply unable to develop the intended skills. And if he\ncan\u2019t develop the skills, there is no way he can become a useful member\nof a team and part of a winning system.\nIn other words, muscle development precedes skill development, and\nskill development precedes team and system development. The body is\na natural system and is governed by natural laws. The sports metaphor\nis a very apt and powerful image that we can relate to the broader area\nof enlarging capacity and \ufb01nding our voice. Personal development\nprecedes the building of trusting relationships, and trusting\nrelationships are an absolute prerequisite to developing an organization\ncharacterized by teamwork, cooperation and contribution to the wider\ncommunity.\nFor instance, let\u2019s say that a person is unable to even keep the\npromises he makes to himself\u2014his life is inconsistent, \ufb02aky and mood-\nbased. Is there any way that he\u2019d be able to develop healthy, trusting\nrelationships with others? The answer is obvious. And if there was a\nlack of trust in his relationships with others, would he have any\nfoundation for an effective family or team organization that makes\nsigni\ufb01cant contributions? Again, the answer is obvious: no.\nJust like a child can\u2019t run before it can walk or walk before it can\ncrawl, just like you can\u2019t do calculus until you understand algebra, and\nyou can\u2019t do algebra until you understand basic math, some things of\nnecessity come ahead of others.

communicating people\u2019s worth and potential\nso clearly that they come to see it in themselves. Notice the words worth\nand potential. People must feel an intrinsic sense of worth\u2014that is, that\nthey have intrinsic value\u2014totally apart from being compared to others,\nand that they are worthy of unconditional love, regardless of behavior\nor performance. Then when you communicate their potential and\ncreate opportunities to develop and use it, you are building on a solid\nfoundation. To communicate people\u2019s potential and to give them a\nsense of extrinsic worth is a \ufb02awed foundation, and their potential will\nnever be optimized.\nQ: There are so many leadership books out today\u2014what in\nyour material is truly unique that adds value?\nA: What is unique about this leadership material that adds real\nvalue? I would say \ufb01ve things: First\u2014the sequential development. I know\nof no book that focuses on the absolute necessity of personal\ndevelopment and integration before trust can be built at the\nrelationship level and insists that both of these are necessary before you\ncan build effective, sustainable organizations, including families.\nSecond\u2014it takes a whole-person approach. I know of no material out\nthere that deals with all four intelligences, giving the highest emphasis\nto spiritual intelligence, or conscience, in guiding the other three.\nThird\u2014it is based entirely upon principles that are timeless, universal\nand self-evident, as differentiated from values that all people and\norganizations have but which may not be based upon principles. As you\nknow, values control our behavior, but principles control the\nconsequences of our behavior. When you pick up one end of the stick,\nyou pick up the other.

It is also\ndone before, which brings a sense of con\ufb01dence and trust in the leader.\nBut it is only when people actually experience for themselves how a\nconscience-driven person models path\ufb01nding, aligning and empowering\nthat leadership actually takes place. People then come to know for\nthemselves how respected, appreciated and valued they are. Why?\nBecause their opinions are sought. Their input is respected. Their\nunique experience is valued. They are genuinely involved in the\npath\ufb01nding process. They are participants. They don\u2019t just hear about\nthe mission statement and the strategic plan. They help develop them.\nThey own them. Or if the mission statement and strategic plan were\ndeveloped beforehand, they identify with them either because they\nmade a conscious choice to do so before they came on board, or\nbecause of their admiration for the model leader.\nSometimes mental and emotional identi\ufb01cation is a more powerful\nforce than involvement. You see this with the followers of a Gandhi, a\nMartin Luther King, or a Nelson Mandela. Perhaps you, yourself, have\nso admired someone that you buy deeply into their vision, even though\nyou were not involved in creating that vision. This is identi\ufb01cation. It is\na very powerful psychological force, sometimes even more powerful\nthan actual participation. This is particularly the case with vision and\nstrategic planning, more than with values. Brilliant visionaries and\nstrategists are often in a class by themselves, and this is often recognized\nby the culture itself\u2014but again only if trust and personal\ntrustworthiness are there. Ultimately, however, identi\ufb01cation is based\non involvement of some sort, directly or indirectly.\nModeling is also not the work of just an individual; it\u2019s the work of a\nteam. When you have a team of people that builds on each individual\u2019s\nstrengths and organizes to make individual weaknesses irrelevant, you\nhave true power in an organization. So when you think of modeling,\nthink of an individual and a complementary team. The spirit of a\ncomplementary team is that you are there to play a unique role that\ncompensates for the weaknesses of others.

The salesperson could listen\nmore for needs and adapt with integrity. The marketing person could\nguarantee the integrity of merchandising and advertising.

It\u2019s the power of focus. Habit 3 is the paradigm of priority, action\nand execution\u2014I have the ability and responsibility to carry out that\npromise.\nHabits 4, 5 and 6\u2014Think Win-Win, Seek First to Understand, Then\nto be Understood, and Synergize\u2014are the paradigms of abundance in\ndealing with others\u2014abundance of respect, of mutual understanding\n(balancing consideration and courage), and of valuing differences.

You simply have to decide what matters most to\nyou. What are your highest values? What vision do you have for your\nlife? What about your work at home as a father, mother, grandfather,\ngrandmother, aunt, uncle, sister, brother, cousin, son or daughter?\nWhat kind of service would you like to give your community, your\nchurch, your neighborhood and others in need? How important is your\nhealth? How are you going to maintain and enhance your health? Some\nhave said that health is wealth and that without it, no other wealth\nmatters. What about your mind, your growth and development? How\nimportant is that to you? What about your work? What are your true\ntalents? Where does your passion lie? Where are the greatest needs in\nyour organization and in the marketplace? On what projects and\ninitiatives does your conscience inspire you to take action? How will\nyou truly make a difference in your work? What will your legacy be?\nThe focusing tool of the \ufb01rst role is a personal planning system.

My wife and children were supportive, so I threw myself into it\nwholeheartedly. I felt a great weight of responsibility and was driven and\nenergized by a sense of purpose. In the second year of the project, I worked\nliterally day and night. The importance of the work consumed me. I felt I was\ndoing well in staying involved in the kids\u2019 lives, including ball games and dance\nrecitals. I usually had dinner each evening with the family. I thought I was\nmanaging pretty well. The last six months were the most intense, and it was\nduring this time that I noticed how often my wife was becoming frustrated with\nme\u2014usually over the smallest things (at least they seemed so to me).

So we did. And the \ufb02oodgates opened.\nShe started to share what it was like to be \u201calone\u201d all this time. Even when I\nwas home, she felt I was somewhere else. Because our tradition of having weekly\ndates became much less frequent and because I usually stayed up long after she\nretired each night, we didn\u2019t talk and share like we used to, and she felt more\nand more isolated, unappreciated, and disconnected. I wasn\u2019t communicating\nmuch of anything. My nearly single-minded focus on my work and other\ncommitments became a constant reminder of where my thoughts and feelings\nwere not focused. She reminded me that I had even forgotten her birthday until\nthe day was half over. And it wasn\u2019t the forgetting that was so bad, as it was a\nsymbol of what the whole year had seemed like.\nWhen I asked her why she hadn\u2019t opened up and shared her concerns earlier,\nshe said she didn\u2019t want to upset me and distract me from the project. I looked in\nher eyes and saw deep pain and loneliness. I felt horrible. I was amazed and\nembarrassed that I had been so clueless. Her openness about her loneliness helped\nme realize how empty I had been for so long. We had both become less effective\n\u2014both personally and together. I apologized and reassured her that there was no\nperson or thing on earth more important to me than her. But my words didn\u2019t\nseem to get through. I realized that too many other things had communicated\nsomething different for too long. My apology and commitment to reprioritize\nmy life helped, but it didn\u2019t make things all better overnight. It took days and\nweeks and months of consistent effort\u2014talking, sharing, being there, making\nand keeping promises, putting aside work at the end of the day for the family,\nand apologizing and regrouping when I got a little off track\u2014before the full\nfeeling of trust and emotional connection was restored and exceeded what it had\nbeen before.\nSince I visited with my friend, he has completed two more multiyear\nprojects just as demanding and signi\ufb01cant as the \ufb01rst.

I learned that both the quality\nof our marriage and my own happiness had very little to do with what she was\ndoing for me, and everything to do with what I was trying to do every day to\nfoster her happiness, share her burdens, and partner with her in the things we\ncare most about. I\u2019ve learned that unity in my relationship with my wife is one\nof the greatest, enabling sources of power of my life\u2014not only in our most\nsigni\ufb01cant work in the family and community together, but in every area of my\nlife, including professionally. It creates a well of strength, peace, joy, belonging\nand energy that fuels my best work, creativity and drive to contribute.\nFinally, I\u2019m learning that strong relationships require real effort and\nsacri\ufb01ce. They require putting someone else\u2019s well-being, growth and happiness\nbefore your own. And oh, how it\u2019s worth it! For such effort is the door to our\nown happiness. What would we do without the pull of such relationships that\nhelp us get outside ourselves and become equal to our potential?\nMORAL AUTHORITY AND THE SPEED OF TRUST\nMy friend\u2019s experience is a tremendous illustration of the reality that\nrelationships are governed by natural laws. Enduring trust in a\nrelationship cannot be faked, and it is rarely produced by a dramatic,\nonetime effort. It is the fruit of regular actions inspired by the\nconscience and heart. In The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, I\nintroduced a metaphor for trust called the Emotional Bank Account.

I suggest\nit\u2019s the absence of sel\ufb01shness and the presence of humility. It\u2019s the\nwillingness to subordinate oneself to another person, to a principle, or\nto a higher cause. It\u2019s realizing that life is not just about me and mine;\nusing the words of the philosopher Martin Buber, it\u2019s about \u201cI and\nThou\u201d\u2014feeling profound reverence for the worth and potential of\nevery person.\nMoral authority, trust and bonding can evaporate over time in the\nabsence of making continual deposits, particularly with people we work\nand live around all of the time. This is so because their expectations are\nso much higher. With people we haven\u2019t seen for years, we can often\npick up where we left off. The trust and bonding and love are restored\nimmediately because there are simply no expectations of continual\ndepositing.\nMoral Authority: The principled exercise of free choice,\nwhich almost always involves some form of sacri\ufb01ce.\nA third common characteristic is that, like most worthwhile things\nin life, they require a sacri\ufb01ce.

You\u2019ll notice that each deposit represents a choice to use\nyour birth-gifts in an effort to sacri\ufb01ce an ineffective personal habit and\nreplace it with an action that builds moral authority in relationships\nwith others.\nNo system can long command the loyalties of men and women which does\nnot expect of them certain measures of discipline, and particularly self-\ndiscipline.

HINCKLEY\nSEEKING FIRST TO UNDERSTAND\nWhy would Seek First to Understand be the \ufb01rst deposit? One simple\nreason. You do not know what a deposit is to another person until you\nunderstand them from their frame of reference. What may be a high-\nlevel deposit to you may be a low-level deposit to another, or even a\nwithdrawal. What may be an important promise to you may be\nunimportant to another. How you express your honesty, openness,\nkindness and courtesy may be perceived completely differently when\nseen by others through their unique cultural or personal \ufb01lters. While\nthe underlying principles of each deposit hold true in every situation, it\nrequires an understanding of others within their frame of reference to\nknow how to speci\ufb01cally implement the practice.\nAfter learning of the idea of making deposits into the Emotional\nBank Account, one woman decided she was going to try it out. This is\nwhat she shared with me about her experience:\nI decided I would do something special for my husband to improve our\nrelationship. I \ufb01gured that having the kids in clean clothes when he got home\nand getting the laundry done quicker would really make him happier.\nAfter about two weeks of being Miss Superwasherwoman with no feedback\nfrom him\u2014I mean nothing, I don\u2019t even think he had a clue\u2014I started getting\na little ticked. \u201cThis stuff ain\u2019t worth nothin\u2019,\u201d I thought. Then, suddenly, one\nnight when he\u2019d gone thoughtlessly to sleep between clean sheets, I saw the light-\nbulb click on above my head.\n\u201cOh my gosh. He doesn\u2019t give a hoot about Zac\u2019s clean face or his clean jeans.\nThat\u2019s what makes me happy.

He left his of\ufb01ce to come into the outer of\ufb01ce, where I was\nawaiting my appointment. After greeting me, he graciously ushered me\ninto his of\ufb01ce and had me sit right next to him, in front of his desk,\nwhere we could talk eye-to-eye without any physical structure between\nus. He basically said, \u201cStephen, thank you so much for coming in. I\u2019m\nanxious to understand whatever you want me to understand.\u201d\nI had prepared for this visit for a considerable period of time and had\ndeveloped an outline of my presentation. I gave him a copy of the\noutline and covered it slowly, point by point. Except for a few clarifying\nquestions, he never interrupted. He listened so intently and completely\nthat when my thirty-minute presentation was over, I felt completely\nunderstood. He made absolutely no comment\u2014neither agreeing,\ndisagreeing, or committing. But at the end he simply stood up, looked\nme in the eye, and, as he shook my hand, expressed how much he\nappreciated and admired me. That was it.

When they\u2019re happy with the promise, they like you.\nAnd we like to be liked.\nThat which we desire most earnestly we believe most easily. All kinds\nof people are suckered into deals and agreements because they want\nsomething so badly they\u2019ll believe most any explanation, story or\npromise of getting it. They turn a blind eye to negative information\nand go on in their believing.\nBut promise keeping is hard.

Genuine kindness,\ncourtesy and respect come from a deep character reservoir of SQ and\neven obviate the necessity for a lot of social niceties and ceremonial-\ntype courtesies.\nOften when I speak to children at home or school, I tell them that if\nthey will learn and use four expressions (totaling only ten words)\nsincerely and consistently, they can get what they want in most cases.\nOne word\u2014\u201cplease.\u201d\nTwo words\u2014\u201cthank you.\u201d\nThree words\u2014\u201cI love you.\u201d\nFour words\u2014\u201cHow may I help?\u201d\nAdults are big children.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35d2b74f-fa59-49f3-9a24-aa2fe7388c00": {"__data__": {"id_": "35d2b74f-fa59-49f3-9a24-aa2fe7388c00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "203", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2bba3d5d-1604-4fc8-aa4a-c6a815cba34d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "203", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "bf8eb2f4d860ec98b88083a5c4c4617e1fc79be6351499a7e53f5365360211aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "43133ff2-3688-41fa-a717-97753e65dee8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "d88c08595dcc2c0ec83c4648e5b3feb6e8581912e84433b1dee16b1ad581b2be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c2533aed-d164-48df-90c0-24e88d08dd63", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "c70fe749d19a883a89f484e9d314e8350e746400187a0fdf99970fa1802951da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2ce12147ac21203ff0b00ee19452b5e8c3b5bec3948f257d887274a81c37ec2c", "text": "THINKING WIN-WIN OR NO DEAL\nWin-lose thinking is the underlying assumption of almost all\nnegotiations and problem solving. It comes from society\u2019s scarcity\nmind-set, which says the more the other guy wins or gets, the less there\nis for me. The goal is to get what you want\u2014which usually means\n\ufb01guring out how to manipulate or gain the advantage over the other\nguy to get him to concede as much as possible. Many try to work out\ndifferences with others, even family members, in the same way. Both\nparties battle it out until one concedes or they settle on a compromise.\nI remember making a presentation in which I taught the idea that the\nkey to breaking out of this win-lose mind-set is to become emotionally\nand mentally settled on championing the other party\u2019s \u201cwin\u201d as much as\nyour own. It requires courage, abundant thinking, and great creativity\nto not settle on anything that is a compromise for either party. I taught\nthat a further key was to begin with a No Deal option. In fact, until No\nDeal is a viable option in your own mind, that is, until you are totally\nprepared to go for No Deal, to walk away, to agree to disagree\nagreeably unless both parties actually feel it is a win for them, you\u2019ll\n\ufb01nd yourself manipulating and often pressuring or intimidating others\nto go along with your win. But when No Deal is truly a viable option,\nyou can honestly say to the other, \u201cUnless this is a true win for you and\nyou deeply and sincerely feel it, and unless it\u2019s a true win for me and I\ndeeply and sincerely feel it, let\u2019s agree right now to go for No Deal.\u201d\nThat process is so liberating, so freeing, and it requires such a\ncombination of humility and kindness with strength and courage that\nonce it is truly hammered out, both parties are transformed; such\nintense bonding takes place that afterwards they will always be loyal to\neach other in each other\u2019s absence.\nAfter the presentation, a man who had been sitting on the front row\ncame up to me to thank me for this very timely idea. He represented\nDisney-Epcot and said he intended to practice it the very next day in a\nsituation regarding the showcasing of a particular country at the Epcot\nCenter.

It is one of the highest tests of both character and the depth of\nbonding that has taken place in a relationship. This is particularly the\ncase when everyone seems to be joining in on bad-mouthing and piling\non someone who is not present.

He really wanted to apologize. His apology was so humble\nand sincere without any form of self-justi\ufb01cation that it caused me to\nlook into my own heart and take responsibility for my part. We were\nknitted together again.\nA former colleague told me once of an experience she had working\nwith a high-level executive team at a weeklong retreat. The president\nbegan one morning by encouraging the group to really seek to listen to\nand understand others in their discussions before making their own\npoints. Before moving on in the meeting, he shared a powerful personal\nexperience illustrating his point.\nWhat follows is her brief account (the names have been changed, as\nthey have been in many of the stories included in this book) of what\nhappened later that afternoon:\nIn the middle of our discussions, a rather obnoxious exec started to say\nsomething about a business approach he was struggling with. The group verbally\npounced on him. To be honest, I would have liked to pounce on him myself, but\nknew it wasn\u2019t my place. Then I heard Jack, the president, laughing out loud,\nright in this guy\u2019s face. He was actually making fun of him in front of the whole\ngroup. Of course, the group jumped on the bandwagon.\nI was stunned. Only a few hours before, the president had shared this moving\nexperience about the value of waiting your turn, trying to understand a person\u2019s\nactions. Now he was doing the very opposite. I couldn\u2019t very well reprimand him\nin front of the whole group. So, I just glared at him. He read me loud and clear.\n\u201cThat was ugly. If you don\u2019t do something to rectify this right now, I\u2019ll walk\nout!\u201d Really. I was so angry, I was ready to walk out on the whole group. They\nhad just reverted to their old, combative behavior and poisonous group\ndynamics.\nHe stared back at me. I pulled myself up taller in my seat and glared, \u201cBack\nat you, pal.\u201d He shrunk back in his seat. I kept on looking right at him. This\nwent on for about \ufb01ve minutes, during which his team members were still\ncrucifying the poor guy. Then all of a sudden, the president stopped the meeting.\nHe said, \u201cStop, I did something wrong. David, I want to ask your forgiveness.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d David was a bit baf\ufb02ed.

It is also one of the most needed. So many people have serious\nblind spots they never come to grips with because no one knows how to\ngive them feedback. People are too fearful of rupturing a relationship\nor of having their personal future compromised by \u201ctaking on\u201d their\nboss.\nThe hypocrisy in the belittling situation in Jack\u2019s story became so\nevident to the offender that it wasn\u2019t an issue of having a blind spot: it\nwas one of ego. The courage and integrity of the woman who gave the\nfeedback were more powerful than status and position. That\u2019s why it\nworked. Sometimes it isn\u2019t more powerful and won\u2019t work, which may\nnecessitate going to the person privately and making a reconciliation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97f830de-30ee-498d-b4b9-47faf18aea7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "97f830de-30ee-498d-b4b9-47faf18aea7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "209", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ea414625-f3e6-449b-9104-aa93a6221b4f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "209", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "507e4356a6133c80fa59206f9bfcc83696efa2fb6b66ccaf3f0f0a9feb534a8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "08db25da-7ce3-4b47-b6e8-e0bf2df1954b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "208", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "c6af140055c52af2147dd38418aca31daa7ed554b22861b745c59a72097dd1ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5a089747-1ac1-47f3-a925-1df3fc1e4865", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "210", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "d061f2525f50c898bad99609c2135ebe23db608c95cb2a87945b0f7a86f2b1b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "afa77848a936e685058b738f48ee99bee5af159b17361fc148d0f87c0467b3ff", "text": "The best way to give feedback in a private circumstance is to describe\nyourself, not the person. Describe your feelings, your concerns or your\nperceptions of what was happening rather than accusing, judging and\nlabeling the person. This approach often causes the other person to\nbecome open to information about his or her blind spot without being\nso personally threatened.\nPeople in authority should make pushing back and giving feedback\nlegitimate. When you do receive feedback, you need to speak explicitly\nabout it and express gratitude for it, however much it may hurt. If you\ndon\u2019t do this explicitly, a norm will develop which basically says that\ngiving negative feedback and pushing back is a form of disloyalty and\ninsubordination. Making \u201cpushing back\u201d legitimate, even a social norm,\nalso frees the person with formal authority so that he or she can also\n\u201cpush back\u201d without fearing it will hurt feelings, rupture a relationship\nor be taken as \u201cthe \ufb01nal word.\u201d\nWe all need feedback, particularly about our blind spots\u2014those\ntender areas of weakness that we defend.

He hesitated to speak, so I primed the pump a little by\ndescribing what it must be like to live next door to us. He then opened\nup with a gush of feelings, complaints and concerns that he and his wife\nhad.

I asked him to hold off from\nmaking such a rash decision until we could get together. He said, \u201cI\u2019m\nnot calling to counsel with you; I\u2019m calling to inform you. I\u2019m\nresigning.\u201d I realized then that I had not listened to him, which I then\nproceeded to do. He then opened up a Pandora\u2019s box of experiences,\ncomplaints and feelings, including even stronger ones from his wife. As I\ngenuinely listened, the negative energy in his expression was dissipated,\nand on his own he agreed to visit with me as soon as I returned.\nWhen I returned he brought his wife to my of\ufb01ce, and they were\npleasant on the surface. But as soon as we began to discuss the real\nissues, the deep anger and resentment gushed forth. I continued to\nlisten until they felt understood, and then they became very open. I\nthen taught them about the space between stimulus and response and\nhow the greatest harm is not in what people do to us but in our\nresponse to what they do to us.

I started Part 2 of this book with a\nstory of how early in my adult life someone saw potential within me\nthat far exceeded what I saw in myself. He saw beneath the surface,\nbeyond the obvious and evident. He looked into my heart and eyes and\nspirit and saw the raw, undeveloped, unseen seeds of greatness that lie\nwithin each one of us.\nSo he entrusted me with a charge and responsibility far beyond my\nexperience and perceived ability. He gave me his trust, without\nevidence, without proof. He simply believed and expected I would rise\nto the challenge, and he treated me accordingly. It was an act of faith.\nBut that act of faith so af\ufb01rmed my worth and potential that I was\ninspired to see it in myself. His faith in me increased my own faith and\nvision of myself. I aspired to the highest and most noble inclinations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1562bd24-60d3-43b1-8362-1ee2a9605877": {"__data__": {"id_": "1562bd24-60d3-43b1-8362-1ee2a9605877", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "213", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "739c01d6-fea5-43ac-b6ab-43de9390797a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "213", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "9c71b13f13a099f95dfbbb74a9f8c2a7b9239f108e1fa97a1cee11c000aa09c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6de1fb6e-9435-4902-a826-840a29e9a123", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "a7033346b0b445cc03aacbfa0d70d39ae0266bb499a901cf0464c690c48685b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "608ae447-2cd7-4bef-af39-c879f55430a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "214", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "b9da6de6e306d45d18246aa81f8a4ac81e4747cad4ab09a93aa85bd34f01a4cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ed97c2720065cd3d428b224f4ea51f12e23e2f996abd764ddb8fd0ee2f4d8b0a", "text": "within me.

It is the highest form of motivation. Love also becomes a\nverb. It is something you do; you love or serve others; you trust others;\nyou see their worth and potential and provide opportunity and\nnourishment and encouragement. If they do not live true to this trust, it\nwill deteriorate and they will not be inspired to see their own worth\nand potential. They won\u2019t have the ability to communicate to others\ntheir worth and potential. To them, trust will not be a verb. In fact, it\nwill be very hard for an untrustworthy person to trust anybody or to\nbelieve in anybody in a sustainable way.\nAllow me to illustrate, with a story I share often, how love, like trust,\ncan become a verb.

They\u2019re driven by feelings.\nHollywood has generally scripted us to believe that we are not\nresponsible, that love is a feeling. But the Hollywood script does not\ndescribe the reality. If our feelings control our actions, it is because we\nhave abdicated our responsibility and empowered them to do so.\nProactive people make love a verb. Love is something you do: the\nsacri\ufb01ces you make, the giving of self, like a mother bringing a newborn\ninto the world. If you want to study love, study those who sacri\ufb01ce for\nothers, even for people who offend or do not love in return. If you are a\nparent, look at the love you have for the children you sacri\ufb01ced for.\nLove is a value that is actualized through loving actions. Proactive\npeople subordinate feelings to values. Love, the feeling, can be\nrecaptured.\nWhere is the very best place to give trust, to communicate people\u2019s\nworth and potential? Without any question, it\u2019s the family. If the family\nis dysfunctional, where is the next best place? The school. The teacher\nbecomes like a surrogate parent who begins the trusting process again.\nRemember the power you hold to give your trust to others.

Negative\nattitudes are really a symptom of deeper things going on. People need\nto feel understood. Seeking to understand another is so therapeutic, so\nhealing and so af\ufb01rming to them that oftentimes you end up working\non the roots rather than just sniping about the lack of fruits.\nThird, sometimes there are other forces at play stronger than your\nexample or your relationship with a person. Sometimes you simply\nhave to smile and not obsess about it. This keeps the negativity cancer\nfrom metastasizing. Remember, when you build your emotional life on\nthe weaknesses of others, including their negative attitudes, you disem-\npower yourself and empower their negative attitudes to continue to\nmetastasize their cancer cells through the culture. You can\u2019t change all\nthings; you can\u2019t change people; you can only change yourself.\nHowever, I have found that sometimes if people can develop a skill or\ncompetency that is in alignment with a fundamental gift or talent that\nthey have, their attitude toward themselves, toward others and toward\nlife signi\ufb01cantly improves. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re going to try to\nteach someone to play tennis. Would it be best to talk to them about\ntheir attitude if they seemed a little low or discouraged and negative?\nWould it be best to give them more knowledge about ground strokes\nand volleys? Or would it simply be best to get out there on the court,\ntake the skill route, and have them literally practice the skills until they\nwanted more knowledge? You would then \ufb01nd their attitude naturally\nbecoming more positive as they come to enjoy the game. These are\nthree routes to make improvements: knowledge, skill and attitude. Most\npeople focus on the attitude and knowledge routes. I suggest the key to\nthose two is the skill route\u2014people simply feel better about themselves\nand about life when they\u2019re good at something.\nQ: What is the best advice you\u2019ve ever given as it relates to\nmotivation?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eaf500d8-4a91-42d9-8f40-c2c472ed9878": {"__data__": {"id_": "eaf500d8-4a91-42d9-8f40-c2c472ed9878", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0c2a07e2-fb5a-407e-a30f-e288f4cbba79", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "2ada7b0c20741c2587fd24e1d2dd96d760631a312289e5d53c15159210002a35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad05b2a5-eee4-41c4-931a-5bdddb7882b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "6f3d232cbe14d1eb3dcb54266ee0ab6000b78ad812a773673471e299f2c0dfdb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "697c7f34-e016-4781-bee7-1c1f5c4735dd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "2aa271ed778557a0242a34e4f6fe99e2bf3a103b2925cf30f01c7da088e66334", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "89963674a73d9e0fd8fcd04516394c78aade8bcd7e18559565fe360ccbd6affd", "text": "A: First, I would say be an example and a model and then af\ufb01rm the\nworth and potential of other people so clearly that they come to see it\nin themselves\u2014not just through your words but also through aligned\nreinforcing systems and incentives.

On the other hand, I\u2019ve seen people\nreally drawn to each other, offering encouragement, getting really\npleased when the other person sees the second aspect of the picture.\nCreative thinking involves breaking out of established patterns in order to\nlook at things in different ways.\nEDWARD DE BONO, M.D., AUTHOR OF LATERAL THINKING\nThere are four very important things to learn about communication\nthrough this perception experience:\n1.\u00a0You have to be sincerely open and listen to the other person if\nyou are to reach an understanding of what they see and why they\nsee the world the way they do\u2014the foundation of seeking for\nThird Alternatives.\n2.\u00a0Those things you experience before being presented with new\ninformation color the way you look at that information. If one\nsecond of conditioning can split a room in two, imagine what a\nlifetime of conditioning can do? What about in your family?\nHow do you interpret things? People may be looking at the\nsame exact facts, but the meaning of those facts is interpreted\nthrough prior personal experiences. People create meaning and\nact on the basis of how they perceive the world. Remember, we\ndo not see the world as it is; we see the world as we are.\nPerceptions are set long before efforts to synergize. Therefore,\nthe most signi\ufb01cant work to be done involves communication\nthat leads to mutual understanding.\n3.\u00a0There isn\u2019t just one way to interpret something. The challenge\nlies in creating a shared vision that accurately and honestly\nconsiders all the differing viewpoints, while still remaining true\nto the original vision.

Whenever people meet together, the\nTalking Stick is present. Only the person holding the Talking Stick is\npermitted to speak. As long as you have the Talking Stick, you alone\nmay speak, until you are satis\ufb01ed that you are understood. Others are\nnot permitted to make their own points, argue, agree or disagree. All\nthey may do is attempt to understand you and then articulate that\nunderstanding. They may need to restate your point to make sure you\nfeel understood, or you may just simply feel that they understand.\nAs soon as you feel understood, it is your obligation to pass the\nTalking Stick to the next person and then to work to make him feel\nunderstood. As he makes his points, you have to listen, restate and\nempathize until he feels truly understood. This way, all of the parties\ninvolved take responsibility for one hundred percent of the\ncommunication, both speaking and listening. Once each of the parties\nfeels understood, an amazing thing usually happens. Negative energy\ndissipates, contention evaporates, mutual respect grows, and people\nbecome creative. New ideas emerge. Third alternatives appear.\nRemember, to understand does not mean to agree with. It just means to be\nable to see with the other person\u2019s eyes, heart, mind and spirit. One of\nthe deepest needs of the human soul is to be understood. Once that\nneed is met, the personal focus can shift to interdependent problem\nsolving. But if that very intense need for understanding is not met, ego\nbattles take place. Turf issues arise. Defensive and protective\ncommunication is the order of the day. Sometimes contention, even\nviolence, can erupt.\nThe human need to feel understood is like the lungs\u2019 need for air. If\nall the air were suddenly sucked out of the room you are in, how\nmotivated would you be to get air? Would you be interested in having a\ndiscussion or working out some difference between you and everyone\nelse? Of course not. You\u2019d want just one thing. You\u2019d be open to other\nthings only after you got air.

It requires such self-control and draws such maturity into\nthe communication that even though it may seem inef\ufb01cient at \ufb01rst, it\nbecomes highly effective\u2014that is, it achieves the desired results in terms\nof both synergistic decisions and synergistic relationships, bonding and\ntrust.\nHere\u2019s how a meeting might go with you as the facilitator of the\nIndian Talking Stick concept:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbdf45b5-bd48-464c-859e-a3f1268a7874": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbdf45b5-bd48-464c-859e-a3f1268a7874", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "233", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "896f5e81-a68c-4d95-8b26-ff386f13f46b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "233", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "20a557453f1ead2c47a140b75b78671a81ad9d384da05c51ae119abbdc9e9723", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "67151166-9d60-48aa-bb68-65d92fa10676", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "232", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "0e7d9844f5e5657352132873cef8eed928450a81f3e025f81796767527453a54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce9f6454-64af-453e-af0b-57659d96477d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "234", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "4468bf5013d79831934935962a7559af51021318fe9cc8d5fb8ad68ddca5a2bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "96ba79bd304748733b58f62f4e13c002898617d2d7b001e204e48ca3f00edc4c", "text": "Sylvia and Roger are in a meeting.

Because over 90 percent of all communication problems are\ncaused by differences in either semantics or perceptions. Again,\nsemantics means the way you de\ufb01ne words or terms. Perception means\nhow you interpret data. Whenever people listen to each other with true\nempathy, that is, within the other\u2019s frame of reference, both semantic\nand perceptual problems dissolve\u2014just as they do with the saxophone\nplayer/woman exercise. This is because they\u2019re listening from within\nthe other\u2019s frame of reference. They\u2019re sensing how the other de\ufb01nes\nwords and terms, or how the other interprets meaning and data. This\nputs them on the same song sheet, using the same language, which then\nenables them to get on with problem solving on the other 10 percent of\nthe genuine disagreements. The spirit of this mutual understanding is\nso af\ufb01rming, so healing, so bonding that when people do discuss their\ndisagreements, they do it in agreeable ways and usually are able to solve\nthem either through synergy or a form of compromise.\nSILENCE IS ALSO a key to Indian Talking Stick communication with\nothers. We must be quiet, even silent, to begin to deeply empathize\nwith others. Of the power of this silence, Robert Greenleaf commented,\n\u201cOne must not be afraid of a little silence. Some \ufb01nd silence awkward\nor oppressive. But a relaxed approach to dialogue will include the\nwelcoming of some silence. It is often a devastating question to ask\noneself, but it is sometimes important to ask it. In saying what I have in\nmind, will I really improve on the silence?\u201d\nON A LIGHTER NOTE, let me share a story I heard recently that shows the\neffects of a person who does not understand or practice the Indian\nTalking Stick concept.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69fcf60b-b5f8-464b-b956-6adfe6c2c1ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "69fcf60b-b5f8-464b-b956-6adfe6c2c1ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "235", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c60371e1-a72b-49c8-9563-34843dca4d64", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "235", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "43dda7efe41561edcd5db33706c3681fe47f0fa95a6de9c12312f552c81ebb2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce9f6454-64af-453e-af0b-57659d96477d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "234", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "4468bf5013d79831934935962a7559af51021318fe9cc8d5fb8ad68ddca5a2bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a8ad10f-bc80-411f-9405-2212ee4155a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "236", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "26e9d8bcaf7db8da0dabb4d0b076ea96289a16794ed9bdb88571e70822f60d3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "57bc398fe7d6f602af33e89f1907de918bb901e2d72201c72293d9283bea7c4a", "text": "A farmer went into his attorney\u2019s of\ufb01ce wanting to \ufb01le for divorce\nfrom his wife.

I\nremember a colleague once sharing with me the story of his father and\nmother. It beautifully illustrates this point:\nMy father had been a superb dentist for thirty years when he was diagnosed\nwith amyloidosis, a rare disease similar to cancer. The doctors gave him six\nmonths to live. Because of the effects of the disease, he had to give up his practice.\nSo, here sits this man who had always been extremely active, with nothing to do\nall day except think about his fatal disease.\nHe decided he wanted to take his mind off things by putting a greenhouse in\nthe backyard, where he could grow his favorite plants. This wouldn\u2019t be a fancy\nglass greenhouse that you see behind Victorian mansions. This would be one of\nthose kit greenhouses complete with corrugated plastic for a roof and black plastic\nsides. My mother didn\u2019t want that monstrosity in her yard. She said she would\ndie if the neighbors saw it. The g-word topic got to the point where they couldn\u2019t\nspeak civilly to each other about it. I think the issue became the site of all their\nredirected anger about the disease.\nOne day my mom told me she was thinking about really trying to understand\nmy father\u2019s point of view. She wanted to resolve this situation so that both could\nbe happy. She knew she didn\u2019t want a greenhouse in her backyard. She\u2019d rather\nhave morning glory in all her perennial \ufb02owerbeds than that greenhouse. But\nshe also knew she wanted my father to be happy and productive. She decided to\nstep back and let him do it. She decided that my dad\u2019s happiness meant more to\nher than either the backyard or the neighbors.\nAs it turns out, that greenhouse kept my dad going long after the doctors had\ngiven up on him. He lived for two and a half more years. At night, when he\ncouldn\u2019t sleep because of the chemotherapy, he went out to the greenhouse to see\nhow his plants were doing. In the morning, watering those plants gave him a\nreason to get up. His greenhouse gave him work to do, something else to\nconcentrate on while his body collapsed on him.

They came right\nback in front of the store on the very day of opening and set up their\nfruit and vegetable stands. It made a mess, and made it slightly dif\ufb01cult\nfor people to even get into the store.\nWhat would you do if fruit vendors crowded around, messed up the\nsidewalk, and partially blocked your doorway on the day you opened\nyour new store?

We\u2019ve discussed the SKILLS of building trust and seeking Third\nAlternatives. The 4 Roles of Leadership represent Third Alternative\nleadership and in\ufb02uence. They give you KNOWLEDGE of the\nprinciples of transformational leadership.\nAgain, this in\ufb02uence begins with modeling trustworthiness so that\npeople will have con\ufb01dence in you. But as you know, they need more\nthan your trustworthiness. Good intentions do not compensate for bad\njudgment. People need a model to see how they can work and lead in a\ndifferent way\u2014different from what they are used to, different from the\nculture of the organization they work in, different from the controlling,\ntransactional traditions of the Industrial Age. Your most important\nmodeling will be to show others how a person who has found his or her\nvoice acts inside the other three primary roles of a leader\u2014path\ufb01nding,\naligning and empowering.\nTo help you model these three roles, I will begin the chapters\ncovering the three remaining roles of leadership by 1) identifying the\nmyth and the reality that surrounds each role, and 2) describing three\ncontrasting alternatives for approaching each role. The key in any\nchallenge is to always seek the higher Third Alternative.\nIn this chapter we take on the leadership challenge of uniting people\nwho are diverse in their strengths and ways of seeing the world into one\nvoice, one great purpose. It\u2019s the role of path\ufb01nding shared vision, values\nand strategic priorities.

One of the most striking \ufb01ndings from\nthis vast study was this: Managers are typically rated high on work ethic\n(modeling) but low on their ability to provide focus and clear direction\n(path\ufb01nding). As a result, people are neither clear about, nor\naccountable to, key priorities, and whole organizations fail to execute.\nThe disconnect is this\u2014people are working harder than ever, but\nbecause they lack clarity and vision, they aren\u2019t getting very far.

As soon as the people involved agree upon what matters\nmost organizationally, they share the criteria that will drive all\ndecisions that follow. This clarifying communication gives focus. It\ncreates order. It creates stability. It also enables agility, which we will\nexplore later in the empowering role.\nVision on a personal scale translates into path\ufb01nding in an\norganizational setting. Whereas individually you identify what you see\nto be signi\ufb01cant, now your challenge and role is to create a shared view\nof what is important, of what matters most.

Through an interactive process, you\ncreate a written mission statement and strategic plan (value proposition\nand goals). The mission statement should encompass your sense of\npurpose, your vision and your values.\nThe strategic plan is a crisp description of how you will provide value\nto your customers and stakeholders; it\u2019s your value proposition.

The cultural practices may vary depending\non where you are in the world, but my experience around the world is\nthat regardless of the kind of organization or level within the\norganization, when statements of values are produced in this way, they\nwill basically deal with the four parts of our nature\u2014body, mind, heart\nand spirit\u2014and the four basic needs: to live, to love, to learn and to\nleave a legacy.

But if it produces a mission statement and strategic plan\nthat are simply announced, it will not work. The key is that there must\nbe emotional connection; otherwise, the criteria developed will not be\nused to align structures, systems, processes and cultures.

But now the crucial question becomes, How do we\nexecute both values and strategy consistently without relying on the\nformal leader\u2019s continuing presence to keep everyone going in the right\ndirection? The answer is alignment\u2014designing and executing systems and\nstructures that reinforce the core values and highest strategic priorities of\nthe organization (selected in the path\ufb01nding process).\nConsider the current structures, systems and processes in your\norganization. Do they enable people to execute top priorities, or do\nthey create roadblocks to doing so? Are they consistent with the\norganization\u2019s espoused values? It is the responsibility of leadership to\nremove obstacles\u2014not create them. Yet the process of alignment\nrequires a deep and humble examination of self and many \u201csacred cow\u201d\norganizational systems and structure.\nORGANIZATIONAL TRUSTWORTHINESS\nAs mentioned earlier, the organization is the second major source of\ntrust. When trustworthy people work within structures and systems\nthat are not aligned with the organization\u2019s espoused values, the\nuntrustworthy systems will dominate every time. You simply won\u2019t have\ntrust. Through tradition and cultural expectation, these systems and\nprocesses become so deeply embedded in the organization that they are\nfar more dif\ufb01cult to change than individual behavior.\nxQ data con\ufb01rm that there is a serious \u201ctrust gap\u201d within\norganizations.

Simply\nput, alignment is institutionalized trustworthiness.

The third role, aligning, deals with the\nquestion. Are we on target? Are we on track regarding what matters\nmost?\nThe truth is, as mentioned earlier, we\u2019re all off track most of the\ntime, all of us\u2014every individual, family, organization or international\n\ufb02ight to Rome. Just realizing this is a signi\ufb01cant step. But, for many of\nus, the feeling of being off track brings with it discouragement and\ndespair. It needn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be so depressing. Knowing we\u2019re off\ntrack is really an invitation to realign ourselves with true north\n(principles) and recommit ourselves to our destination.\nRemember, our journey as an individual, team or organization is like\nthe \ufb02ight of an airplane. Before the plane takes off, the pilots \ufb01le a \ufb02ight\nplan. They know exactly where they\u2019re going. But during the course of\nthe \ufb02ight, wind, rain, turbulence, air traf\ufb01c, human error and other\nfactors act upon the plane. They move that plane slightly in different\ndirections so that most of the time it is not even on the prescribed \ufb02ight\npath. But barring anything too major, the plane will still arrive at its\ndestination.\nNow how does that happen? During the \ufb02ight, the pilots receive\nconstant feedback. They receive information from instruments that\nread the environment, control towers, other airplanes\u2014even sometimes\nfrom the stars.

What kind of results are you getting in the marketplace? Are\nyour shareholders happy with the return on their investment? What\nabout your employees? Are they happy with the return on their mental,\nphysical, spiritual and emotional investment? What about suppliers?\nWhat about the community? Do you have any sense of social\nresponsibility toward the kids, toward the schools, toward the streets,\ntoward the air and water, toward the context in which your employees\nwork and raise their families? What about all these results from these\nstakeholders? What about the customers? How is it going? What are\nthe results? How do they benchmark against world-class standards? You\nhave to study and examine all these stakeholder results and then\nexamine the gap between those results and your strategy.\nEffectiveness is the balance between production of desired results (P) and\nproduction capability (PC).* In other words, it\u2019s the golden eggs that\npeople want and the goose that lays them. Sometimes we call this the\nP/PC Balance. The essence of effectiveness is achieving the results you\nwant in a way that enables you to get even more of these results in the\nfuture.\nOver the last ten years there have been many approaches developed\nto measure the P/PC Balance. I have frequently taught the importance\nof 360-degree feedback suggesting that the \ufb01rst 90 degrees represents\n\ufb01nancial accounting, and the remaining 270 degrees consists of\nscienti\ufb01cally gathered information on the perceptions of the\norganization\u2019s key stakeholders and the strength of their feelings around\nthose perceptions.\nThere are many names for this kind of feedback. One of the\nstrongest recent movements calls it The Balanced Scorecard. Sometimes I\nhave called this approach double bottom-line accounting. Traditional\naccounting has always focused on the single bottom line (the golden\neggs).

Before we knew\nit our daughter with whom we had the toughest time ran to the shower, turned\non the water, and got in. My wife and I smiled at each other in mild\namazement. We had real hopes it would work with her\u2014but \ufb01fteen minutes\nearly? Within \ufb01fteen or twenty minutes, she had done everything that usually\ntook an hour and a half, and she even had time to get her piano practicing done.\nWe had a great morning. The other kids did the same thing.\nAfter the kids were out the door, my wife said, \u201cI am in heaven. But the real\ntest is, will it continue?

Though we haven\u2019t always had quite the\nenthusiasm of that \ufb01rst morning, with only occasional exceptions (which were\nfollowed by earlier bedtimes for a few days) they\u2019ve all gotten up and done\neverything on their own. We\u2019ve also found it helpful to come together every few\nmonths to evaluate how we\u2019re doing and to renew our commitment.\nIt\u2019s been wonderful to see the children grow in their sense of \u201cI can do this. I\nhave the power. I am responsible.\u201d We try not to remind. It\u2019s been a profound\nlesson, and it\u2019s totally changed the nature of our family life in the mornings.\nYou can see that the parents were initially trying to work from the\nmind-set that says the kids needed to change, but gradually came to the\nawareness that they needed to change. The mind-set was that kids need\nreminding. You\u2019ve got to check up, hover, and follow up. Maybe you\u2019ve\nworked for someone like that. It\u2019s classic management/control thinking.\nBut then the parents re\ufb02ected on their children\u2019s worth and potential\n\u2014particularly their potential. They knew the children had tremendous\nworth, and they loved them unconditionally, but they had fallen into\nthe typical trap of looking at their children through the lens of\nmisbehavior. They had also not yet clearly communicated to the\nchildren their potential. They did this by asking some simple questions\nabout whether the children believed\u2014if they had the mind to\u2014that\nthey could do the basic things of getting up, doing their jobs, and\ngetting ready to go to school. Because the children so identi\ufb01ed\nemotionally with the parents, the communication took. Commitments\nwere made and kept; potential was released; responsibility was taken;\ngrowth took place; mutual trust and con\ufb01dence increased; and peace of\nmind and peace at home resulted. It\u2019s a beautiful, powerful example of\nempowerment.\nEven though this is a simple little family problem, most people can\nidentify with it. Sometimes in organizations, as well as families, people\nbelieve in the potential of others but not in their worth, so they\u2019re not\npatient, persistent, long-suffering, trust-giving, and self-sacri\ufb01cing. It\u2019s\njust not worth it to them; it becomes a cost-bene\ufb01t analysis and they\nperhaps unwittingly conclude that the cost is too great.

It\u2019s a knowledge worker economy;\nwealth creation has migrated from money and things to people.\nOur greatest \ufb01nancial investment is the knowledge worker. Just\nconsider what has been invested in the knowledge workers in your\norganization through salary, bene\ufb01ts, possible stock options and what it\ntook to recruit and train them. That often translates into hundreds of\nthousands of dollars per year per person!\nQuality knowledge work is so valuable that unleashing its potential\noffers organizations an extraordinary opportunity for value creation.\nKnowledge work leverages all of the other investments that an\norganization has already made. In fact, knowledge workers are the link\nto all other organizational investments. They provide focus, creativity,\nand leverage in utilizing those investments to better achieve the\norganization\u2019s objectives. Intellectual and social capital are key to\nleveraging and optimizing all other investments.\nAnd so it is absolutely critical that the empowerment of people\n(aligning voices) is seen as the fruit of modeling, aligning and\npath\ufb01nding. Otherwise, you will see organizations talk and proclaim\nempowerment but remain unable to walk their talk. They have no\ncommon vision, no discipline and de\ufb01nitely no passion.\nEmpowerment is not a new idea.

It means that when you know something is wrong and that it\nwould result in serious consequences to the overall mission and values\nof the organization, then you should respectfully push back, no matter\nwhat your position or rank. You should speak up and declare yourself in\nopposition to the momentum of a growing decision that you are\nabsolutely convinced is dead wrong. That\u2019s essentially living from your\nconscience\u2014allowing your inner voice or light to guide your actions\nrather than giving in to the sway of peer pressure.\nIt is important for people in high positions to of\ufb01cially endorse the\ndoctrine of stubborn refusal.

It\nillustrates what can happen in a job that, though honorable, is by nature\nmore menial, unskilled, and low-paid\u2014janitoring. The idea is that if\nyou can have a whole person in a whole job that consists of emptying\ngarbage cans, sweeping and mopping \ufb02oors, and washing walls and\n\ufb01xtures, etc., you could have it in any job.\nA management development instructor was once training a group of\n\ufb01rst-level supervisors how to enrich a job so that it intrinsically\nmotivates employees. One of the foremen who supervised janitors gave\nconsiderable resistance to the theory. It seemed too idealistic and\nunrelated to most of the work a janitor does\u2014at least the janitors he\nsupervised. All the supervisors being trained agreed that there was a\nproblem with the janitors. They agreed with the supervisor that most of\ntheir janitors were uneducated, transient, and were there because they\ncouldn\u2019t get a better job. Essentially their only desire was to clock in\nand clock out. Some were even alcoholics.\nBecause the instructor knew the maintenance foreman was sincere in\nhis belief that motivation and empowerment theory was of no use to\nhim in working with janitors, he abandoned his prepared discussion and\nbegan to deal with the janitorial problem directly.\nHe placed three words on the blackboard: Plan, Do, and Evaluate\u2014\nthree major elements of job enrichment. He then asked the\nmaintenance foreman and the other foremen to list the maintenance\nduties and activities associated with these three words.

How about having the janitors identify\nparts of the job they would be interested in taking on?\u201d (In the actual\nsituation, the wording was not quite so blunt, and the entire group of\nforemen got involved in the discussion about what additional areas of\nplanning and evaluating could be given to the janitors.)\nOver the next \ufb01ve months, the case of the janitors was discussed, at\nleast brie\ufb02y, in every session held by the instructor. Meanwhile, the\nmaintenance supervisor was engaging more of the minds and hearts of\nthe janitors by steadily giving them more responsibility for the\nplanning, doing and evaluating of their work. They tested out new\nmachines and made the \ufb01nal recommendations for purchase. They\nexperimented with different waxes to determine which stood up the\nbest under normal usage.

Learn to appreciate the unique\nstrengths of each person, but if their \u201cmaverick-ness\u201d reaches the point\nwhere they are poisonous, negative and critical, then I would say set up\na feedback system that gives them feedback.

It\u2019s not\njust a matter of what we have called The Great Jackass Theory\nof Human Motivation, where you just throw more money at\nthe workers. In fact, studies have shown that when you have a\nKnowledge Worker approach, workers place salary fourth in\npriority behind trust, respect and pride. Why? Because when\npeople have intrinsic satisfaction in their work, extrinsic, or\nexternal, factors are less important. But when there are no\nintrinsic satisfactions in the work, then money becomes the\nmost important thing. Why? With money you can buy\nsatisfactions off the job.

There is one\nsimple reason\u2014how people de\ufb01ne the high-priority goals, along\nwith mission and values, will govern every other decision.\nTherefore, when there is a lack of clarity and commitment, you\nwill have nothing but confusion about what is truly important.\nThe end result is that urgency will de\ufb01ne importance.

Add a second goal to that \ufb01rst goal, and research\nshows your chances of achieving both goals drop to 64 percent.

Players\ntend to do whatever they want, the game stops for a few jokes, and the\nplaying is not very focused. But when they start keeping score, things\nchange. There\u2019s a new intensity. Huddles happen. Plays are improvised.\nPlayers adapt quickly to each new challenge. And the speed and tempo\nbuild dramatically.\nThe same thing happens at work. Without crystal-clear measures of\nsuccess, people are never sure what the goal truly is. Without measures,\nthe same goal is understood by a hundred different people in a hundred\ndifferent ways. As a result, team members get off track doing things that\nmight be urgent but less important. They work at an uncertain pace.\nMotivation \ufb02ags.\nThat is why it\u2019s so crucial to have a compelling, visible, accessible\nScoreboard for your strategic plan and crucial goals. Most work groups\nhave no clear measures of success, nor do they have any way to see how\nthey are doing on their key priorities.\nAccording to our xQ studies, only about one in three workers can\nrefer to clear, accurate measures to gauge their progress or success on\nkey goals.

Remember also that\nbecause ends preexist in the means, you might consider\nincluding measures in the Scoreboard regarding principle-\ncentered values.\n3.\u00a0Post the Scoreboard and ask people to review it every day, every\nweek, as appropriate.

This is why your\nbroken arm has to wait while the doctors work on a patient with a brain\ninjury, even though you might have arrived \ufb01rst.\nIn triage reporting, everyone reports quickly on the vital few issues,\nleaving the less important issues for another time. They focus on key\nresults, major problems, and high-level issues. This doesn\u2019t mean that\nonly \u201curgent\u201d issues are discussed. It means that only \u201cimportant\u201d issues\nare discussed, even if some of these issues are not \u201curgent.\u201d This table\ncontrasts the typical staff meeting with an effective accountability\nsession:\nTable 7\nFinding Third Alternatives: In effective accountability sessions,\nthere is intense focus on how to achieve the key goals. The principle\nhere is that a new goal that we\u2019ve never achieved before requires doing\nthings we\u2019ve never done before.

The\ndominant institution in any society needs to take responsibility for the\nwhole. But business has not had such a tradition. This is a new role, not\nwell understood or accepted. Built on the concept of capitalism and free\nenterprise from the beginning was the assumption that the actions of\nmany units of individual enterprise, responding to market forces and\nguided by the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of Adam Smith, would somehow add up\nto desirable outcomes. But in the last decade of the 20th century, it has\nbecome clear that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d is faltering. It depended on\noverarching meanings and values that are no longer present. So business\nhas to adopt a tradition it has never had throughout the entire history of\ncapitalism: to share the responsibility of the whole. Every decision that is\nmade, every action that is taken, must be viewed in light of that\nresponsibility.\nTHE AGE OF WISDOM\nI believe that this millennium will become the Age of Wisdom.

They are in charge.\nWe are not. Pride teaches us that we are in charge. Humility teaches us\nto understand and live by principles, because they ultimately govern the\nconsequences of our actions. If humility is the mother, courage is the\nfather of wisdom. Because to truly live by these principles when they\nare contrary to social mores, norms and values takes enormous courage.\nCourage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something\nelse is more important than fear.\nAMBROSE REDMOON\nThe following chart visually describes these three generations\u2014\nnotice also their opposites in all three generations (see \ufb01gure 15.3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe68e156-e99f-4f52-98d6-3726a073dbbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe68e156-e99f-4f52-98d6-3726a073dbbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "346", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dac69d87-e9a5-4eef-bf25-3e614f9b0229", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "346", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "1962936b27724ac7e83a93222a9b53aa3993dfad3beecdae3c017ea34142869d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8046c88-a760-4319-8f3a-bc7d84ae16ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "345", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "77b80c396376c8194274df35c54be5c0ecb33440fe3cb0a95a7184a59dfa992a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b520a6d0-8ea7-43ec-8d11-9e45c3b0eefa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "347", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "dcb1118fe348256ae6f0c30e642e70251211619e6ff2da3bbc2aabb2522c6fa3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b5a185016764808316850bfd95c7fa476a3b6f26f5d8c53544028fe6f03eb84d", "text": "You notice that integrity has two children\u2014wisdom and the\nabundance mentality.

Moral\nauthority is the gaining of in\ufb02uence through following principles.\nMoral dominion is achieved through servanthood, service, and\ncontribution. Power and moral supremacy emerge from humility,\nwhere the greatest becomes the servant of all. Moral authority or\nprimary greatness is achieved through sacri\ufb01ce. Robert K. Greenleaf,\nthe modern founder of the servant leadership movement, put it this\nway:\nA new moral principle is emerging which holds that the only authority\ndeserving one\u2019s allegiance is that which is freely and knowingly granted\nby the led to the leader in response to, and in proportion to, the clearly\nevident servant stature of the leader. Those who choose to follow this\nprinciple will not casually accept the authority of existing institutions.\nRather, they will freely respond only to individuals who are chosen as\nleaders because they are proven and trusted as servants. To the extent that\nthis principle prevails in the future, the only truly viable institutions will\nbe those that are predominantly servant-led.8\nIt has generally been my experience that the very top people of truly\ngreat organizations are servant-leaders. They are the most humble, the\nmost reverent, the most open, the most teachable, the most respectful,\nthe most caring.

India, the second largest nation in the world, with over a billion\npeople, is an independent democracy because of him. Isn\u2019t it truly\namazing that he was never elected and had no formal authority?

As a person\nengages in the sequential 8th Habit process of \ufb01nding one\u2019s own voice,\nmaking the choice to expand her in\ufb02uence by inspiring others to \ufb01nd\ntheir voice, she increases her freedom and power of choice to solve her\ngreatest challenges and serve human needs; she learns how leadership can\neventually become a choice not a position, so that leadership, the enabling\nart, is widely distributed throughout organizations and society, and\ntherefore, while we manage or control things, we lead (empower)\npeople.\nRegarding the people paradigm, we have learned that every human\nbeing is precious in his or her own right, endowed with enormous,\nalmost in\ufb01nite potential and capacity. We\u2019ve learned that the pathway\nto enlarging that capacity is magnifying our present gifts and talents.\nThen, almost like a \ufb02ower blooming in the spring, additional gifts and\ntalents are given or opened up to us and our \u201chardwired\u201d capacities in\nall four areas are unleashed to lead a balanced, integrated, powerful life.\nThe opposite is also the case. If we neglect our gifts and talents, they,\nlike an unused muscle, will atrophy and waste away.\nWe\u2019ve also learned that the culture we live and work in has\n\u201csoftwared\u201d us for mediocrity, or in other words, to fall far short of our\npotential. Anything less than a whole person is a thing, and things have\nto be controlled or managed.

It is in so doing that we \ufb01nd our true \u201cvoice\u201d in\nlife. Haddon Klingberg, Jr., author of the insightful biography of Viktor\nand Elly Frankl, When Life Calls Out to Us (one of the two projects he\nworked on prior to his passing), articulated this central theme of\nFrankl\u2019s life in this way:\nFor Frankl, since spirituality is in its essence self-transcendence, it brings\nwith it human freedom. But it is not freedom from as much as freedom to.\nWe are not free from our biological nature, whether instinctual drives,\ngenetic legacies, or the functions and malfunctions of our brains and\nbodies. Nor are we free from the grasp of social, developmental, and\nenvironmental in\ufb02uences. But we are free to take a stand toward these,\neven against them. We are free to do what we will with the cards we are\ndealt, to choose what response we will make to fateful events, to decide\nwhat cause or persons will receive our devotion.\nAnd this freedom to carries an obligation to. Each of us is responsible\nfor something, to someone. By using our freedom to act responsibly in the\nworld, we uncover meaning in our lives. It is only when our will to\nmeaning is frustrated that we settle for the pursuit of personal pleasure\n(Freud), or for \ufb01nancial and social success (Adler).\nWhen a person exercises spiritual freedom and responsibility, there\nfollows a host of effects: peace of mind, good conscience, and\ncontentment. But these occur naturally\u2014as by-products, so to speak. But\npursuing any of these directly makes their attainment improbable or\nimpossible, he said. There is nothing quite like striving for peace of mind\nto keep one edgy. To center one\u2019s effort on achieving a good conscience\nmay lead to hypocrisy or guilt\u2014or both. To make health one\u2019s chief aim\nmay bring on something akin to hypochondria. For Frankl, these are not\nends to be pursued for their own sake or even for one\u2019s own good.

If you can get together enough caring people who are\nthe natural and formal leaders in education, business, government and\nother professions, and even people without formal authority who have a\nlot of moral authority but a strong interest, and you get them involved\nin the process of teaching the 7 Habits and the four roles to\norganizations and families throughout the community, it\u2019s amazing\nwhat good can come from it.

Is\nthis realistic? Am I unique?\nA: You are not alone. Let me explain why.\nPerhaps you remember\u2014or have seen in a more recent video or\nmovie\u2014the \ufb01lm clips showing the lunar voyage of Apollo 11.\u00a0Those of\nus who witnessed it were absolutely trans\ufb01xed. We could hardly believe\nour eyes when we saw men walking on the moon.\nWhere do you think the most power and energy was expended on\nthat journey into space? Going a quarter of a million miles to the\nmoon? Returning to Earth? Orbiting the moon? Separating and\nredocking the lunar and command modules? Lifting off the moon?\nNo, not any of these. Not even in all of these together. It was lifting\noff from Earth. More energy was spent in the \ufb01rst few minutes of liftoff\nfrom Earth\u2014in the \ufb01rst few miles of travel\u2014than was used in half a\nmillion miles for several days.\nThe gravity pull of those \ufb01rst few miles was enormous. It took an\ninternal thrust greater than both the pull of gravity and atmosphere\nresistance to \ufb01nally break out into orbit. But once they did break out, it\ntook almost no power to do all those other things. In fact, when one of\nthe astronauts was asked how much power was expended when the lunar\nmodule separated from the command module to go down and survey\nthe moon, he answered, \u201cLess than the breath of a baby.\u201d\nThis lunar voyage provides a powerful metaphor for describing what\nit takes to break out of old habits and create new ones. The gravity\nforce of Earth could be compared to deeply embedded habits,\ntendencies programmed by genetics, environment, parents and other\nsigni\ufb01cant \ufb01gures.

Do not\nconfuse the three questions. Don\u2019t try to answer a value question with a\ntraining answer, a motivation question with a value answer, or a\ncompetency question with a motivation answer.

That\nmeans that wealth has migrated from money and things to people\u2014\nboth intellectual and social capital. In fact, our greatest \ufb01nancial\ninvestment is in knowledge workers. Knowledge work has gravitated\nfrom arithmetic to both exponential and geometric contribution\npotential, and this kind of intellectual and social capital is the key to\nleveraging or optimizing all other investments. Furthermore, the\nIndustrial Age management control style and \u201cpeople as expense\u201d\nsystems are becoming increasingly obsolete and/or dysfunctional\nbecause of the competitive forces of the marketplace.

The Constitution attempted to institutionalize the values that\n\u201call Men are created equal\u201d and that they are \u201cendowed by their\nCreator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life,\nLiberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\u201d\nThe Constitution was in alignment with the vision and value system\nof the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration said \u201call\u201d men,\nyet women didn\u2019t have the right to vote for decades, many of the\nfounders were slaveholders, the Emancipation Proclamation did not\npass for over eighty years, and still today there are profound pockets of\nracial prejudice. Cultural moral authority always develops slower than\ninstitutionalized or visionary moral authority. But ultimately, it is the\nkey to developing a harmonious society. The key lies not in\ngovernment, which represents force or law, nor in private individuals or\nprivate business organizations, which represent freedom. It lies within\nindividuals and groups adopting common meanings and values that are\ntruly connected to their hearts and minds. This level of volunteerism\ncreates a civil society, which is the higher Third Alternative between law\nand freedom. This is the underlying assumption behind the thinking\nand writing of Adam Smith, author of The Wealth of Nations. Long\nbefore he wrote this classic he wrote a book called The Theory of Moral\nSentiments. This work, which was foundational to his later works,\nincluding The Wealth of Nations, was based on the idea that intentional\nvirtue and goodwill are the foundation of both an economic system of\nfree enterprise and a political system of a representative democracy. He\nacknowledged that if individual virtue deteriorated, neither the free\nmarket nor a democracy could ultimately survive.\nQ6: You say that one of the basic problems is that we are using\nthe industrial model in a Knowledge Worker Age, but aren\u2019t we\nstill an industrialized nation?

If you have an authoritarian leader who controls,\nwhat do the followers do? Most passively obey; they wait until told and\ndo what they\u2019re told. The behavior con\ufb01rms the perception of the\nauthoritarian leader to continue to command and control, which, in\nturn, justi\ufb01es the passivity of the followers. In other words, it becomes a\nself-ful\ufb01lling prophecy. All of this disempowers people\u2019s capacities and\nintelligences. It underutilizes them. It turns people into things to be\nmanaged or controlled. The cycle of codependency eventually nurtures\na politicized kiss-up culture where right is de\ufb01ned by compliance or by\nloyalty, and where wrong lies in getting caught.\nThis dynamic also spawns dysfunctional agreement where people say\nyes when they really mean no. It eliminates healthy con\ufb02ict and spawns\nresentment, anger, malicious obedience, low trust, low quality and low\nperformance. Such unexpressed feelings never really die\u2014they\u2019re\nburied alive and come forth later in uglier ways.\nThe authoritarian then carries the responsibility for results and\nfocuses upon ef\ufb01ciency\u2014that is, methods, process and steps so that\nrules begin to take the place of human judgment. All this reinforces\nleadership as a position, not a choice; it becomes part of the cultural\nDNA.

There is no silver bullet. It\ntakes deep commitment, patience and persistence, particularly in\nmaking changes or transitions from one mind- and skill-set to another\nmind- and skill-set.

Similarly, with cultures in\norganizations, there are driving forces and restraining forces. Driving\nforces are usually the logical, economic realities, which would be\nequivalent to \ufb02ooring it, pushing the gas pedal down. Restraining forces\nare usually cultural and emotional and would represent the brake.\nThrough Third Alternatives and synergistic communication,\nrestraining forces are converted into driving forces.

Kirk Lewin\u2019s force \ufb01eld\ntheory is embodied in this answer.\nQ15: Is all this material that new? I have heard these ideas\nfrom my youth.

In the \ufb01fth year, this particular\nspecies of the Chinese bamboo tree grows up to eighty feet. In its initial\nstages, all of the growth went underground in the root. Then, once it\nhad its roots in place, all of the growth went above the ground and was\nvisible, giving evidence to the cynics of the growth that had been\noccurring all along.

TO\nACTION\nDEVELOPING PHYSICAL INTELLIGENCE\u2014PQ\nLet\u2019s start with the body, with Physical Intelligence (PQ), because the\nbody is the instrument of the mind, heart and spirit. If we can\nsubordinate the body to the spirit\u2014that is, our appetites and passions\nto our conscience\u2014we become masters of ourselves. People whose lives\nare a function of their appetites and passions rather than their\nconscience cannot give of themselves. Their space between stimulus and\nresponse is narrowed\u2014they lose personal freedom, thinking all the\nwhile that they are exercising it. The body is a good servant but a bad\nmaster.\nThe Greek expression of the self-mastery formula for life\u2014\u201cknow\nthyself, control thyself, give thyself\u201d\u2014is a magni\ufb01cent sequence. I\nsuggest there are three fundamental ways to develop our physical\nintelligence. First, wise nutrition; second, consistent balanced exercise; third,\nproper rest, relaxation, stress management, and prevention thinking.\nResearch is now clear that the inability to manage oneself ef\ufb01ciently leads\nto premature aging, diminished mental clarity, and even blocked access to\nour innate intelligence. The converse is also true: Increasing internal\ncoherence leads to more ef\ufb01ciency in all physiological systems and greater\ncreativity, adaptability, and \ufb02exibility.1\nDOC CHILDRE AND BRUCE CRYER", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c893af9f-bb9c-43b8-81b1-0ab14492147b": {"__data__": {"id_": "c893af9f-bb9c-43b8-81b1-0ab14492147b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "384", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "87be1be6-4236-478c-a585-d0c2f7c859cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "384", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "40f262ecacd4d0dd56a8c9b0d7d7400f92c1289f6c817c9b71b360071135b145", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "99c6f24c-a1ff-4acb-9bc8-7a5211210f8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "383", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "a2fc35fb0c7c09c381887b5743a83bfc0d2188589a843d460d8d50c78724f7e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "10da191b-68e4-46bc-8e9e-e6b1412b3abb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "385", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "d90e6267b2095b3778be0a254c9afc0e07cf22a9b3281236fef6c52a5768c718", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6f6098e12be72a2f1696c4748579a1a5f496c4e16e3ac7d2130d0801602590c3", "text": "Figure A1.1\nThese three ways are widely understood and accepted by most\npeople in the civilized world. They\u2019re really common sense. But\ncommon sense is not common practice. Very few people practice all\nthree of them.\nIn their book, The Power of Full Engagement, Jim Loehr and Tony\nSchwartz emphasize that managing energy, not time, is the key to high\nperformance and personal renewal. They certainly respect time\nmanagement, but they suggest that the highest criterion to be used in\nthe management of one\u2019s time is how you manage your energy. By\nstudying nature and the natural laws that govern all humanity, they\nemphasize the importance of respecting the cycle that oscillates\nbetween activity/ performance and rest/renewal. They use the whole-\nperson approach: body, mind, heart and spirit. They focus on the\nimportance of habits, which they call rituals, to increase our energy and\nperformance capability.\nWise Nutrition\nMost of us know what we should and shouldn\u2019t eat.

Eustress comes from the\npositive tension between where we are now and where we want to go\u2014\nsome meaningful goal or project or cause that really turns us on and\ntaps into our talents and passion; in short, our voice. Through good\nempirical research, Dr. Selye taught how eustress braces the immune\nsystem and increases longevity and enjoyment of life. In short, we\nshouldn\u2019t avoid stress if it\u2019s the right kind of stress\u2014eustress: It will\nstrengthen us and enlarge our capacity. Of course, it must all be\nbalanced and tempered by the proper rest and relaxation, or what is\ncalled \u201cstress management,\u201d or more properly, \u201ceustress management.\u201d\nSelye explained that women live roughly seven years longer than men\nfor psychological/spiritual reasons, not physiological reasons. \u201cA\nwoman\u2019s work is never done.\u201d\nIn professional circles, it is widely accepted that at least two-thirds of\nall diseases are caused by lifestyle choices that people make. These\nchoices relate to nutrition, to smoking, to insuf\ufb01cient rest and\nrelaxation, to attempting to burn the candle at both ends, and many\nother abuses of the body. Many attribute various diseases to genetic\nfactors, but as we have mentioned before, there is always a space\nbetween stimulus and response, and when people are aware of this space\nand aware of their own capacity to make choices based on principles,\nthey don\u2019t necessarily get the diseases of their genetic predisposition.\nEven most cancers can be cured if they are detected in the \ufb01rst or\nsecond stage before they become aggressive.\nModern Western medicine is primarily focused on treatment rather\nthan prevention, and the treatment usually comes under the two\ncategories of chemistry or surgery.

It\u2019s essentially another word for the space between stimulus\nand response\u2014the space where you can pause and then make a choice\nor decision.\nLet me suggest several other approaches to nurture self-awareness.\nMy daughter, Colleen, probably has seventy different journals \ufb01lled\nwith her thoughts written for her eyes only. Journal writing has enabled\nher to be an observer of her own involvements in life, and also to make\nchoices based on those observations. She has developed the capacity to\nreinvent herself almost on a moment\u2019s notice, simply because her self-\nawareness is so deep and strong. I\u2019ve seen her make important decisions\nbased on the direction of conscience, or spiritual intelligence,\nsubordinating both IQ and EQ, and then later \ufb01nding all three to be in\nharmony.\nThe discipline of putting thoughts into writing is grueling, but\npowerful and clarifying. A failure learned from becomes a success. So in\nthis sense, there need be no real failures, only learning experiences put\nto good use in life.\nAnother powerful way to develop awareness of self and others and to\nmake assumptions explicit is seeking feedback from other people. We\nall have blind spots. Some of them are literally crippling to our\neffectiveness. But if we will cultivate the habit, either informally or\nformally, of seeking feedback from other people\u2014people we care about\nand around whom we work and live\u2014we will fast-track our growth and\ndevelopment. It\u2019s analogous to people doing market research and\nbenchmarking against world-class excellence, rather than local or\nregional competitors. This often gives us information on blind spots\nthat are also blind to other people.\nMany people, myself included, see sincere prayer, pondering prayer,\nlistening prayer, as a way to sense the direction of conscience and to see\nlife as a mission, a stewardship and contribution opportunity. Prayer\nalso can give strength and courage to step back, admit mistakes to\nothers, apologize, recommit, and then get back on track.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a2b4169-d8ef-4891-b3f3-e22ebb2ee8d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a2b4169-d8ef-4891-b3f3-e22ebb2ee8d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "397", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ae416dd-a38d-4c01-b832-233a76a4aecd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "397", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "02c9100af30507d9bfdd6c29d2848bf34fbf624c37d53f78545866c894ff31be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7954931e-04ed-4835-96e6-9a94140154ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "396", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "c227296d11c343fd3addf3161026894229acb095e046eecf0176c03daad40ea8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33823c70-9b86-4333-a6df-efcd03b7a705", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "398", "file_name": "The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_path": "books\\The 8th Habit\\The Eight Habit Stephen Covey.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11763425, "creation_date": "2023-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-11", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-11"}, "hash": "40d5d390263358c8ad98b7496a5904330406475fc349c62da3df5168d5c59a67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7830c0411d69c4f755cfa4fe1b4779c7355c473b9e19ca17d4a9f1d18ead0221", "text": "Learning by Teaching and Doing\nSee again chapter 3.

Continue to do\nthis, and soon your sense of honor will become stronger than your\nmoods. You will develop personal integrity\u2014meaning you are\nintegrated\u2014which will be a great source of power to you.

You can usually see it in the countenance of people, in their\neyes. Usually they neglect their bodies; they often are burned out if\nthey\u2019re not already worn out. Their minds are usually full of\nrationalization, which really means telling oneself rational lies. They\nfeel guilty, which is a very healthy emotion when there is a genuine\nviolation of integrity and conscience. They lack peace; they have\nimpaired judgment. The University of California at Berkeley\nsummarized some of their research in a newsletter with this expression:\n\u201cDoing well by doing good.\u201d\nWhat happens to the heart? Those same people lose control over\ntheir emotions, their ability to understand others, to empathize with\nothers. Their ability to have compassion and love for others is\nsigni\ufb01cantly diminished.\nWhen a man is getting better he understands more and more clearly the\nevil that is still left in him. When a man is getting worse, he understands\nhis own badness less and less. A moderately bad man knows he is not very\ngood; a thoroughly bad man thinks he is all right.

Great-man theories of\nleadership, which dominated any discussion of leadership prior to 1900,\ngave rise to trait theories of leadership. In response, theorists began to\nplace a strong emphasis on situational and environmental factors.\nFinally, theories of integration have been developed around persons and\nsituations, psychoanalysis, role attainment, change, goals and\ncontingencies. Leadership theories since 1970 have developed around\none of these fundamental theories.\nLEADERSHIP THEORIES: REVIEW OF LITERATURE\nTheory Representative\nAuthors/YearSummary\nGreat-Man\nTheoriesDowd (1936)History and social institutions shaped by the leadership\nof great men and women (e.g. Moses, Mohammed,\nJeanne d\u2019Arc, Washington, Gandhi, Churchill, etc.).\nDowd (1936) maintained that \u201cthere is no such thing as\nleadership by the masses.

Leadership is one of the differentiated roles,\nand the person in that position is expected to behave in\na way that differs from others in the group. Leaders\nbehave according to how they perceive their role and\nwhat others expect them to do.

Its practices and\nprocedures are largely a response to one of the most signi\ufb01cant\ndevelopments of the twentieth century: the emergence of large\norganizations. Without good management, complex enterprises tend to\nbecome chaotic in ways that threaten their very existence. Good\nmanagement brings a degree of order and consistency to key\ndimensions like the quality and pro\ufb01tability of products.\n\u201cLeadership, by contrast, is about coping with change. Part of the\nreason it has become so important in recent years is that the business\nworld has become more competitive and more volatile. Faster\ntechnological change, greater international competition, the\nderegulation of markets, overcapacity in capital-intensive industries, an\nunstable oil cartel, raiders with junk bonds, and the changing\ndemographics of the work force are among the many factors that have\ncontributed to this shift. The net result is that doing what was done\nyesterday, or doing it 5% better, is no longer a formula for success.\nMajor changes are more and more necessary to survive and compete\neffectively in this new environment.

In the\nprocess of Max\u2019s becoming the leader of Mr. Harold, notice the four\nroles he participated in. These four roles would have taken place in any\nscenario that worked. First, modeling. Max modeled proactive initiative\nand achieving ethos. He modeled empathy in achieving pathos and\ncourage in achieving logos. As the two genuinely interacted, synergistic\ncommunication took place in coming up with a Third Alternative, far\nbetter than Mr. Harold\u2019s past win-lose command-and-control approach\nand in\ufb01nitely better than Max\u2019s simply doing nothing by numbing out\nand \u201ckissing up.\u201d\nAgain, the essence of modeling, either as an individual or a team, is\nfound in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.\nThe second role\u2014path\ufb01nding\u2014represented the win-win pilot\nprogram and put both Max and Mr. Harold on the same page of\nsecuring more business through creative second-mile customer service\nwithin the guidelines of honest values and good judgment. Modeling\ntrustworthiness and authentic communication produced the trust\nnecessary for path\ufb01nding.

He\nbecomes even more excited the next day when the goose lays another\ngolden egg. Day after day, he awakens to rush to the nest and \ufb01nd\nanother golden egg. Soon he becomes fabulously wealthy.\nBut with wealth comes greed and impatience. Unable to wait day after\nday for the golden eggs, the farmer decides to kill the goose and get them\nall at once. But when he opens the goose, he \ufb01nds it empty. There are no\ngolden eggs\u2014and now there is no way to get any more. The farmer has\ndestroyed the very thing that produced them.\nWithin this fable is a key principle of organizational performance.\nSustained, superior performance is a function of two things: what is\nproduced (the golden eggs) and the capacity to produce (the goose).\nIf organizations focus only on producing golden eggs (achieving\nresults today) and neglect the goose (building capability for tomorrow)\nthey will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs. On the\nother hand, if organizations only take care of the goose with no aim\ntoward the golden eggs, they soon won\u2019t have the wherewithal to feed\nthe goose. The key lies in the balance.\nMaybe your organization is like this:\nWhen confronted with pressure to deliver results, we pull out all the\nstops.
